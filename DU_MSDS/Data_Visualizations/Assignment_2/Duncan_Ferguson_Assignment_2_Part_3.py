""" Assignment 2, Part 3: Construct a list of eight strings that represent days evenly spread
out. Drawing from the random uniform distribution, make an array of eight floats ranging
from 100 to 200 in value. Establish a DataFrame from that list and that array, convert the
dates to pandas datetime objects, and set them to the index. Make two charts in the
same window or canvas as follows: (1) a line plot of the values vs. dates and (2) a bar
chart of the same.
