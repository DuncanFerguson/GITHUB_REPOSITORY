    "## Types of Data Represented as Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous lecture, we observed that in order for features to be interpreted by machine learning models, they must be continuous (numerical and interpretable as numbers). Some features are categorical, often represented with strings. In a classification task, the target vector is typically a categorical feature with the unique values of that feature being the possible class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as not all numerical data is continuous, not all string data is categorical. Generally there are four types of string data:\n",
    "* Categorical data\n",
    "* Free strings that can be symantically mapped to categories\n",
    "* Structured string data\n",
    "* Text data\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical is what we've discussed already, where there is a finite set of string options that can be chosen from for a particular observation. For example, a survey of people's favorite colors could have the options \"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\", \"orange\", \"purple\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly in scenarios like surveys where, instead of a drop-down menu or something, users are able to type freely, typos can occur. Someone could respond saying their favorite color is \"yelow\" for example, which we could map to the category \"yellow\". Some responses could say \"gray\" while others say \"grey\". (An easy way to generally remember which to use is that \"gr**A**y\" is more often used by **A**merican speakers while \"gr**E**y\" is more often used by British **E**nglish speakers.) Some responses could be more specific, saying something like \"navy blue\" which could be mapped to \"blue\". Ultimately \"free strings\" like these are actually categorical but require manual assignment to the categories of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured string data includes things like address, phone numbers, place names, people names, and other identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data is freeform, consisting of phrases or sentences. Text data could generally be considered anything that communicates a thought that isn't one of the previous categories, perhaps an email, a social media post, a speech, a line of dialogue, etc. Some key terms to note here:\n",
    "* An \"atomic\" entity of text can be called a **word**, **term**, or **token** depending on the context.\n",
    "* A body of text (e.g. one email) is called a **document**.\n",
    "* A collection of documents is called a **corpus** (plural: **corpora**).\n",
    "* The field of research related to search through corpora is called **information retrieval (IR)**.\n",
    "* The field of research related to analyzing text data is called **natural language processing (NLP)**.\n",

    "# Example Application: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example of natural language processing is sentiment analysis, where the objective is to classify the **polarity** of a document. Sentiment analysis in its simplest form is a binary classification of either \"positive\" or \"negative\", though certainly more fine-grained classifications exist. In fact, IMDB's rating system is based on values between 1 and 10, but the dataset we will use consolidates these values into \"positive\" if 6 or higher and \"negative\" otherwise.\n",

    "# Representing Text as a Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone familiar with the board game Scrabble or Bananagrams should have an intuitive image in their mind of a bag of letters; both of these games involve placing tiles, each with one letter written on them, in a grid-like fashion to create words. Which letters you get is totally random since all tiles are thrown into the bag and the bag is shaken up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **bag-of-words** approach to representing text follows the same idea but at a word level rather than letters. Regardless of the ordering of the words in our corpus, we consider them all to be separate entities independent of one another. In doing so, we disregard sentence structure, grammar, and other linguistic rules. Certainly this sort of information is extremely useful and is taken into consideration in other models. Surprisingly, however, we can get pretty good performance with a bag-of-words approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting a corpus into a bag of words involves three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Tokenization*: Split each document into words (tokens) by splitting on, say, whitespace and punctuation.\n",
    "* *Vocabulary building*: Create a vocabulary of words that appear in the corpus and number them (say, in alphabetical order)\n",
    "* *Encoding*: For each document, count how many times each word in the vocabulary appears in that document.\n",

One of the most common ways to do this is using the **term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf–idf)** method.

Overall, we want to give higher weight to terms that appear often within a document, but not in very many documents. In other words, we want term frequency (number of times a term appear in a given document) to be higher and document frequency (number of documents a term appears in at least once) to be lower.\n",

    "`sklearn`'s `TfidfTransformer` will take the bag-of-words representation given by `CountVectorizer` and calculate the tfidf of each term and use that value instead of a raw word count. `TfidfVectorizer` is a combination of both of these classes.\n",

    "The tfidf is also normalized so any given document's vector of tfidf scores has a Euclidean norm of 1. In doing so, a document's length (the number of words in a document) is not factored into the calculation. This is significant particularly in information retrieval where tfidf is used to determine what document is most relevant to your query (e.g. Google search). Someone could artificially attach many words or repeat certain words to make the search engine more likely to pick their website, which is prevented by this normalization."

    "# Bag of Words with n-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous plot demonstrates that the words \"excellent\" and \"great\" become associated with positive reviews while \"bad\" and \"worst\" are associated with negative ones, as to be expected. But what if we come across a review that says something like \"The movie is not great\" or \"It's wasn't bad.\"? By viewing each word as independent of all others, we lose connotations that can change with a word like \"not\" (though this is admittedly an extreme version of this predicament). \n",
    "\n",
    "What if, instead, we use *pairs* of words instead of single words (also called **unigrams**)? These pairs are referred to as **bigrams**. Similarly, three-word groups are called **trigrams**, and generally these are called **n-grams**. The overall approach remains the same, but the level of granularity for our vocabulary changes.\n",
