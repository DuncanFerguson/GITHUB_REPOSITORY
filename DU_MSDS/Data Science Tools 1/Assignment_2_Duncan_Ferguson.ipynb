    "# Question 1 - Caesar Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5 points\n",
    "\n",
    "A cipher is an algorithm used for encrypting and decrypting messages. This is a key idea in the field of cryptography, which is basically the study of hidden messages. The idea is that we want to communicate with someone by sending a message, but we don't want any third parties to be able to read the message. Ciphers make it so that only the sender and receiver can read the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of ciphers, but among the simplest is one called the [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), which was supposedly used by Julius Caesar with a shift value of 3. The \"shift value\" refers to how the message's characters are manipulated. The Caesar Cipher is a simple example of a substitution cipher, where each character in the message is replaced by some other character. Here, each character is \"shifted\" by some value to be replaced by the character that many spaces over in the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code below to see a diagram illustrating this idea with a shift value of 2."

    "Define a class called CaesarCipher. The constructor should take the shift value as a parameter and store it as an instance variable. (The classical example is a shift value of 3. Shift values can be any integer, positive or negative, though realistically only values between -26 and 26 make sense when using the English alphabet.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the methods `encrypt` and `decrypt`, which should take a string as a parameter and produce an encrypted message and decrypted message, respectively, given the input string. In cryptography terms, the original message is referred to as \"plaintext\" and the encrypted message is referred to as \"ciphertext\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will assume a message will be provided in lowercase letters with a single space separating each word.** For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    yo there are free sandwiches in the third floor kitchen\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not strictly necessary for this question, it helps if you understand what character encodings are, perhaps the most well-known being [ASCII](https://www.ascii-code.com/). The idea is that computers have an easy means of representing numerical values by using binary units. For the computer to know how to represent characters, we simply assign each character a number. Lowercase letters in ASCII start at 97, so `'a'=97`, `'b'=98`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "* Remember the modulo operator `%` returns the remainder after dividing two integers. This is useful for \"wrapping around\" the alphabet. For example, shifting the character `z` by positive 3 should result in `c`, which is at the start of the alphabet.\n",
    "* `ord(char)` returns the character encoding number for `char`.\n",
    "* `chr(number)` returns the character represented by `number`.\n",
    "* `str.join(lst)` returns a string where each element in the list is used as a string and concatenated together with `str` as the delimiter. For example, `\"..\".join(['a', 'b', 'c'])` returns `'a..b..c'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test your program** by encrypting the message \"there is a quiz tomorrow\" with a shift value of 3 and printing the result, which should be \"wkhuh lv d txlc wrpruurz\". Decrypt the encrypted message to ensure that your decryption works as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you want an extra challenge (meaning this is totally optional), define a helper function (a private function that is intended to be used only be other methods in this class) that performs either an encryption or decryption depending on the value passed into a parameter. `encrypt` and `decrypt` can then call the helper function instead of both functions having nearly the exact same code.*\n",

The dog class should take kingdom, weight, name, species and color.  Finally, create a class Plant that inherits from Organism.  It should take as input kingdom, weight, species and color.  Dog and Plant should have methods to return the values as a string (__str__) and method to return species, color, etc."
