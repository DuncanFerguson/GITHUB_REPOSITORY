# Square 1
#In a script file named square.py, write a program that initializes a variable to store the length of a square in inches,
# calculates the perimeter and area of the square, and outputs the results.  Make sure you label your outputs so the user
# can tell which is which.  Test it by changing the initial value to different ones.â€¨ (4 Points)

# While True adds the element to help input the correct answers
