chapter,i the,family,of
dashwood,had,long,been,settled,insussex
their,estate,was,large,and,their,residence,was,at,norland,park,in
the,centre,of,their,property,where,for,many,generations,they,had,lived
in,so,respectable,a,manner,as,to,engage,the,general,good,opinion
of,their,surroundingacquaintance
the,late,owner,of,this,estate,was,a,single,man,who,lived
to,a,very,advanced,age,and,who,for,many,years,of,his
life,had,a,constant,companion,and,housekeeper,in,hissister
but,her,death,which,happened,ten,years,before,his,own,produced,a
great,alteration,in,his,home,for,to,supply,her,loss,he,invited
and,received,into,his,house,the,family,of,his,nephew,mr,henry
dashwood,the,legal,inheritor,of,the,norland,estate,and,the,person,to
whom,he,intended,to,bequeathit
in,the,society,of,his,nephew,and,niece,and,their,children,the
old,gentleman,s,days,were,comfortablyspent
his,attachment,to,them,allincreased
the,constant,attention,of,mr,and,mrs,henry,dashwood,to,his,wishes
which,proceeded,not,merely,from,interest,but,from,goodness,of,heart,gave
him,every,degree,of,solid,comfort,which,his,age,could,receive,and
the,cheerfulness,of,the,children,added,a,relish,to,hisexistence
by,a,former,marriage,mr,henry,dashwood,had,one,son,by,his
present,lady,threedaughters
the,son,a,steady,respectable,young,man,was,amply,provided,for,by
the,fortune,of,his,mother,which,had,been,large,and,half,of
which,devolved,on,him,on,his,coming,ofage
by,his,own,marriage,likewise,which,happened,soon,afterwards,he,added,to
hiswealth
to,him,therefore,the,succession,to,the,norland,estate,was,not,so
really,important,as,to,his,sisters,for,their,fortune,independent,of,what
might,arise,to,them,from,their,father,s,inheriting,that,property,could
be,butsmall
their,mother,had,nothing,and,their,father,only,seven,thousand,pounds,in
his,own,disposal,for,the,remaining,moiety,of,his,first,wife,s
fortune,was,also,secured,to,her,child,and,he,had,only,a
life,interest,init
the,old,gentleman,died,his,will,was,read,and,like,almost,every
other,will,gave,as,much,disappointment,aspleasure
he,was,neither,so,unjust,nor,so,ungrateful,as,to,leave,his
estate,from,his,nephew,but,he,left,it,to,him,on,such
terms,as,destroyed,half,the,value,of,thebequest
mr,dashwood,had,wished,for,it,more,for,the,sake,of,his
wife,and,daughters,than,for,himself,or,his,son,but,to,his
son,and,his,son,s,son,a,child,of,four,years,old
it,was,secured,in,such,a,way,as,to,leave,to,himself
no,power,of,providing,for,those,who,were,most,dear,to,him
and,who,most,needed,a,provision,by,any,charge,on,the,estate
or,by,any,sale,of,its,valuablewoods
the,whole,was,tied,up,for,the,benefit,of,this,child,who
in,occasional,visits,with,his,father,and,mother,at,norland,had,so
far,gained,on,the,affections,of,his,uncle,by,such,attractions,as
are,by,no,means,unusual,in,children,of,two,or,three,years
old,an,imperfect,articulation,an,earnest,desire,of,having,his,own,way
many,cunning,tricks,and,a,great,deal,of,noise,as,to,outweigh
all,the,value,of,all,the,attention,which,for,years,he,had
received,from,his,niece,and,herdaughters
he,meant,not,to,be,unkind,however,and,as,a,mark,of
his,affection,for,the,three,girls,he,left,them,a,thousand,pounds
apiece
mr,dashwood,s,disappointment,was,at,first,severe,but,his,temper,was
cheerful,and,sanguine,and,he,might,reasonably,hope,to,live,many,years
and,by,living,economically,lay,by,a,considerable,sum,from,the,produce
of,an,estate,already,large,and,capable,of,almost,immediateimprovement
but,the,fortune,which,had,been,so,tardy,in,coming,was,his
only,onetwelvemonth
he,survived,his,uncle,no,longer,and,ten,thousand,pounds,including,the
late,legacies,was,all,that,remained,for,his,widow,anddaughters
his,son,was,sent,for,as,soon,as,his,danger,was,known
and,to,him,mr,dashwood,recommended,with,all,the,strength,and,urgency
which,illness,could,command,the,interest,of,his,mother,in,law,and
sisters
mr,john,dashwood,had,not,the,strong,feelings,of,the,rest,of
the,family,but,he,was,affected,by,a,recommendation,of,such,a
nature,at,such,a,time,and,he,promised,to,do,every,thing
in,his,power,to,make,themcomfortable
his,father,was,rendered,easy,by,such,an,assurance,and,mr,john
dashwood,had,then,leisure,to,consider,how,much,there,might,prudently,be
in,his,power,to,do,forthem
illustration,_his,son,s,son,a,child,of,four,years,old,_
he,was,not,an,ill,disposed,young,man,unless,to,be,rather
cold,hearted,and,rather,selfish,is,to,be,ill,disposed,but,he
was,in,general,well,respected,for,he,conducted,himself,with,propriety,in
the,discharge,of,his,ordinaryduties
had,he,married,a,more,amiable,woman,he,might,have,been,made
still,more,respectable,than,he,was,he,might,even,have,been,made
amiable,himself,for,he,was,very,young,when,he,married,and,very
fond,of,hiswife
but,mrs,john,dashwood,was,a,strong,caricature,of,himself,more,narrow
minded,andselfish
when,he,gave,his,promise,to,his,father,he,meditated,within,himself
to,increase,the,fortunes,of,his,sisters,by,the,present,of,a
thousand,pounds,apiece
he,then,really,thought,himself,equal,toit
the,prospect,of,four,thousand,a,year,in,addition,to,his,present
income,besides,the,remaining,half,of,his,own,mother,s,fortune,warmed
his,heart,and,made,him,feel,capable,ofgenerosity
yes,he,would,give,them,three,thousand,pounds,it,would,be,liberal
andhandsome
it,would,be,enough,to,make,them,completelyeasy

he,could,spare,so,considerable,a,sum,with,littleinconvenience
he,thought,of,it,all,day,long,and,for,many,days,successively
and,he,did,notrepent
no,sooner,was,his,father,s,funeral,over,than,mrs,john,dashwood
without,sending,any,notice,of,her,intention,to,her,mother,in,law
arrived,with,her,child,and,theirattendants
no,one,could,dispute,her,right,to,come,the,house,was,her
husband,s,from,the,moment,of,his,father,s,decease,but,the
indelicacy,of,her,conduct,was,so,much,the,greater,and,to,a
woman,in,mrs,dashwood,s,situation,with,only,common,feelings,must,have
been,highlyunpleasing
but,in,_her_,mind,there,was,a,sense,of,honor,so,keen
a,generosity,so,romantic,that,any,offence,of,the,kind,by,whomsoever
given,or,received,was,to,her,a,source,of,immovabledisgust
mrs,john,dashwood,had,never,been,a,favourite,with,any,of,her
husband,s,family,but,she,had,had,no,opportunity,till,the,present
of,showing,them,with,how,little,attention,to,the,comfort,of,other
people,she,could,act,when,occasion,requiredit
so,acutely,did,mrs,dashwood,feel,this,ungracious,behaviour,and,so,earnestly
did,she,despise,her,daughter,in,law,for,it,that,on,the
arrival,of,the,latter,she,would,have,quitted,the,house,for,ever
had,not,the,entreaty,of,her,eldest,girl,induced,her,first,to
reflect,on,the,propriety,of,going,and,her,own,tender,love,for
all,her,three,children,determined,her,afterwards,to,stay,and,for,their
sakes,avoid,a,breach,with,theirbrother
elinor,this,eldest,daughter,whose,advice,was,so,effectual,possessed,a,strength
of,understanding,and,coolness,of,judgment,which,qualified,her,though,only,nineteen
to,be,the,counsellor,of,her,mother,and,enabled,her,frequently,to
counteract,to,the,advantage,of,them,all,that,eagerness,of,mind,in
mrs,dashwood,which,must,generally,have,led,toimprudence
she,had,an,excellent,heart,her,disposition,was,affectionate,and,her,feelings
were,strong,but,she,knew,how,to,govern,them,it,was,a
knowledge,which,her,mother,had,yet,to,learn,and,which,one,of
her,sisters,had,resolved,never,to,betaught
marianne,s,abilities,were,in,many,respects,quite,equal,to,elinors
she,was,sensible,and,clever,but,eager,in,everything,her,sorrows,her
joys,could,have,nomoderation
she,was,generous,amiable,interesting,she,was,everything,butprudent
the,resemblance,between,her,and,her,mother,was,strikinglygreat
elinor,saw,with,concern,the,excess,of,her,sister,s,sensibility,but
by,mrs,dashwood,it,was,valued,andcherished
they,encouraged,each,other,now,in,the,violence,of,theiraffliction
the,agony,of,grief,which,overpowered,them,at,first,was,voluntarily,renewed
was,sought,for,was,created,again,andagain
they,gave,themselves,up,wholly,to,their,sorrow,seeking,increase,of,wretchedness
in,every,reflection,that,could,afford,it,and,resolved,against,ever,admitting
consolation,infuture
elinor,too,was,deeply,afflicted,but,still,she,could,struggle,she,could
exertherself
she,could,consult,with,her,brother,could,receive,her,sister,in,law
on,her,arrival,and,treat,her,with,proper,attention,and,could,strive
to,rouse,her,mother,to,similar,exertion,and,encourage,her,to,similar
forbearance
margaret,the,other,sister,was,a,good,humored,well,disposed,girl,but
as,she,had,already,imbibed,a,good,deal,of,marianne,s,romance
without,having,much,of,her,sense,she,did,not,at,thirteen,bid
fair,to,equal,her,sisters,at,a,more,advanced,period,oflife
chapter,ii,mrs,john,dashwood,now,installed,herself,mistress,of,norland,and
her,mother,and,sisters,in,law,were,degraded,to,the,condition,of
visitors
as,such,however,they,were,treated,by,her,with,quiet,civility,and
by,her,husband,with,as,much,kindness,as,he,could,feel,towards
anybody,beyond,himself,his,wife,and,theirchild
he,really,pressed,them,with,some,earnestness,to,consider,norland,as,their
home,and,as,no,plan,appeared,so,eligible,to,mrs,dashwood,as
remaining,there,till,she,could,accommodate,herself,with,a,house,in,the
neighbourhood,his,invitation,wasaccepted
a,continuance,in,a,place,where,everything,reminded,her,of,former,delight
was,exactly,what,suited,hermind
in,seasons,of,cheerfulness,no,temper,could,be,more,cheerful,than,hers
or,possess,in,a,greater,degree,that,sanguine,expectation,of,happiness,which
is,happinessitself
but,in,sorrow,she,must,be,equally,carried,away,by,her,fancy
and,as,far,beyond,consolation,as,in,pleasure,she,was,beyondalloy
mrs,john,dashwood,did,not,at,all,approve,of,what,her,husband
intended,to,do,for,hissisters
to,take,three,thousand,pounds,from,the,fortune,of,their,dear,little
boy,would,be,impoverishing,him,to,the,most,dreadfuldegree
she,begged,him,to,think,again,on,thesubject
how,could,he,answer,it,to,himself,to,rob,his,child,and
his,only,child,too,of,so,large,asum
and,what,possible,claim,could,the,miss,dashwoods,who,were,related,to
him,only,by,half,blood,which,she,considered,as,no,relationship,at
all,have,on,his,generosity,to,so,large,anamount
it,was,very,well,known,that,no,affection,was,ever,supposed,to
exist,between,the,children,of,any,man,by,different,marriages,and,why
was,he,to,ruin,himself,and,their,poor,little,harry,by,giving
away,all,his,money,to,his,halfsisters
it,was,my,father,s,last,request,to,me,replied,her,husband
that,i,should,assist,his,widow,anddaughters
he,did,not,know,what,he,was,talking,of,i,dare,say
ten,to,one,but,he,was,light,headed,at,thetime
had,he,been,in,his,right,senses,he,could,not,have,thought
of,such,a,thing,as,begging,you,to,give,away,half,your
fortune,from,your,ownchild
he,did,not,stipulate,for,any,particular,sum,my,dear,fanny,he
only,requested,me,in,general,terms,to,assist,them,and,make,their
situation,more,comfortable,than,it,was,in,his,power,todo
perhaps,it,would,have,been,as,well,if,he,had,left,it
wholly,tomyself
he,could,hardly,suppose,i,should,neglectthem
but,as,he,required,the,promise,i,could,not,do,less,than
give,it,at,least,i,thought,so,at,thetime
the,promise,therefore,was,given,and,must,beperformed
something,must,be,done,for,them,whenever,they,leave,norland,and,settle
in,a,newhome
well,then,_let_,something,be,done,for,them,but,_that_,something,need
not,be,three,thousandpounds
consider,she,added,that,when,the,money,is,once,parted,with,it
never,canreturn
your,sisters,will,marry,and,it,will,be,gone,forever
if,indeed,it,could,be,restored,to,our,poor,little,boy,why
to,be,sure,said,her,husband,very,gravely,that,would,make,great
difference
the,time,may,come,when,harry,will,regret,that,so,large,a
sum,was,partedwith
if,he,should,have,a,numerous,family,for,instance,it,would,be
a,very,convenientaddition
to,be,sure,itwould
perhaps,then,it,would,be,better,for,all,parties,if,the,sum
were,diminished,onehalf
five,hundred,pounds,would,be,a,prodigious,increase,to,theirfortunes
oh
beyond,anythinggreat
what,brother,on,earth,would,do,half,so,much,for,his,sisters
even,if,_really_,hissisters
and,as,it,is,only,halfblood
but,you,have,such,a,generousspirit
i,would,not,wish,to,do,any,thing,mean,hereplied
one,had,rather,on,such,occasions,do,too,much,than,toolittle
no,one,at,least,can,think,i,have,not,done,enough,for
them,even,themselves,they,can,hardly,expectmore
there,is,no,knowing,what,_they_,may,expect,said,the,lady,but
we,are,not,to,think,of,their,expectations,the,question,is,what
you,can,afford,todo
certainly,and,i,think,i,may,afford,to,give,them,five,hundred
pounds,apiece
as,it,is,without,any,addition,of,mine,they,will,each,have
about,three,thousand,pounds,on,their,mother,s,death,a,very,comfortable
fortune,for,any,youngwoman
to,be,sure,it,is,and,indeed,it,strikes,me,that,they
can,want,no,addition,atall
they,will,have,ten,thousand,pounds,divided,amongstthem
if,they,marry,they,will,be,sure,of,doing,well,and,if
they,do,not,they,may,all,live,very,comfortably,together,on,the
interest,of,ten,thousandpounds
that,is,very,true,and,therefore,i,do,not,know,whether,upon
the,whole,it,would,not,be,more,advisable,to,do,something,for
their,mother,while,she,lives,rather,than,for,them,something,of,the
annuity,kind,imean
my,sisters,would,feel,the,good,effects,of,it,as,well,as
herself
a,hundred,a,year,would,make,them,all,perfectlycomfortable
his,wife,hesitated,a,little,however,in,giving,her,consent,to,this
plan
to,be,sure,said,she,it,is,better,than,parting,with,fifteen
hundred,pounds,atonce
but,then,if,mrs,dashwood,should,live,fifteen,years,we,shall,be
completely,takenin
fifteenyears
my,dear,fanny,her,life,cannot,be,worth,half,thatpurchase
certainly,not,but,if,you,observe,people,always,live,for,ever,when
there,is,an,annuity,to,be,paid,them,and,she,is,very
stout,and,healthy,and,hardlyforty
an,annuity,is,a,very,serious,business,it,comes,over,and,over
every,year,and,there,is,no,getting,rid,ofit
you,are,not,aware,of,what,you,aredoing
i,have,known,a,great,deal,of,the,trouble,of,annuities,for
my,mother,was,clogged,with,the,payment,of,three,to,old,superannuated
servants,by,my,father,s,will,and,it,is,amazing,how,disagreeable
she,foundit
twice,every,year,these,annuities,were,to,be,paid,and,then,there
was,the,trouble,of,getting,it,to,them,and,then,one,of
them,was,said,to,have,died,and,afterwards,it,turned,out,to
be,no,suchthing
my,mother,was,quite,sick,ofit
her,income,was,not,her,own,she,said,with,such,perpetual,claims
on,it,and,it,was,the,more,unkind,in,my,father,because
otherwise,the,money,would,have,been,entirely,at,my,mother,s,disposal
without,any,restrictionwhatever
it,has,given,me,such,an,abhorrence,of,annuities,that,i,am
sure,i,would,not,pin,myself,down,to,the,payment,of,one
for,all,theworld
it,is,certainly,an,unpleasant,thing,replied,mr,dashwood,to,have,those
kind,of,yearly,drains,on,one,sincome
one,s,fortune,as,your,mother,justly,says,is,_not_,one,s
own
to,be,tied,down,to,the,regular,payment,of,such,a,sum
on,every,rent,day,is,by,no,means,desirable,it,takes,away
one,sindependence
undoubtedly,and,after,all,you,have,no,thanks,forit
they,think,themselves,secure,you,do,no,more,than,what,is,expected
and,it,raises,no,gratitude,atall
if,i,were,you,whatever,i,did,should,be,done,at,my
own,discretionentirely
i,would,not,bind,myself,to,allow,them,any,thingyearly
it,may,be,very,inconvenient,some,years,to,spare,a,hundred,or
even,fifty,pounds,from,our,ownexpenses
i,believe,you,are,right,my,love,it,will,be,better,that
there,should,be,no,annuity,in,the,case,whatever,i,may,give
them,occasionally,will,be,of,far,greater,assistance,than,a,yearly,allowance
because,they,would,only,enlarge,their,style,of,living,if,they,felt
sure,of,a,larger,income,and,would,not,be,sixpence,the,richer
for,it,at,the,end,of,theyear
it,will,certainly,be,much,the,bestway
a,present,of,fifty,pounds,now,and,then,will,prevent,their,ever
being,distressed,for,money,and,will,i,think,be,amply,discharging,my
promise,to,myfather
to,be,sure,itwill
indeed,to,say,the,truth,i,am,convinced,within,myself,that,your
father,had,no,idea,of,your,giving,them,any,money,atall
the,assistance,he,thought,of,i,dare,say,was,only,such,as
might,be,reasonably,expected,of,you,for,instance,such,as,looking,out
for,a,comfortable,small,house,for,them,helping,them,to,move,their
things,and,sending,them,presents,of,fish,and,game,and,so,forth
whenever,they,are,inseason
i,ll,lay,my,life,that,he,meant,nothing,farther,indeed,it
would,be,very,strange,and,unreasonable,if,hedid
do,but,consider,my,dear,mr,dashwood,how,excessively,comfortable,your,mother
in,law,and,her,daughters,may,live,on,the,interest,of,seven
thousand,pounds,besides,the,thousand,pounds,belonging,to,each,of,the,girls
which,brings,them,in,fifty,pounds,a,year,a,piece,and,of
course,they,will,pay,their,mother,for,their,board,out,ofit
altogether,they,will,have,five,hundred,a,year,amongst,them,and,what
on,earth,can,four,women,want,for,more,than,that,they,will
live,socheap
their,housekeeping,will,be,nothing,atall
they,will,have,no,carriage,no,horses,and,hardly,any,servants,they
will,keep,no,company,and,can,have,no,expenses,of,anykind
only,conceive,how,comfortable,they,willbe
five,hundred,ayear
i,am,sure,i,cannot,imagine,how,they,will,spend,half,of
it,and,as,to,your,giving,them,more,it,is,quite,absurd
to,think,ofit
they,will,be,much,more,able,to,give,_you_something
upon,my,word,said,mr,dashwood,i,believe,you,are,perfectlyright
my,father,certainly,could,mean,nothing,more,by,his,request,to,me
than,what,yousay
i,clearly,understand,it,now,and,i,will,strictly,fulfil,my,engagement
by,such,acts,of,assistance,and,kindness,to,them,as,you,have
described
when,my,mother,removes,into,another,house,my,services,shall,be,readily
given,to,accommodate,her,as,far,as,ican
some,little,present,of,furniture,too,may,be,acceptablethen
certainly,returned,mrs,johndashwood
but,however,_one_,thing,must,beconsidered
when,your,father,and,mother,moved,to,norland,though,the,furniture,of
stanhill,was,sold,all,the,china,plate,and,linen,was,saved,and
is,now,left,to,yourmother
her,house,will,therefore,be,almost,completely,fitted,up,as,soon,as
she,takesit
that,is,a,material,considerationundoubtedly
a,valuable,legacyindeed
and,yet,some,of,the,plate,would,have,been,a,very,pleasant
addition,to,our,own,stockhere
yes,and,the,set,of,breakfast,china,is,twice,as,handsome,as
what,belongs,to,thishouse
a,great,deal,too,handsome,in,my,opinion,for,any,place,_they_
can,ever,afford,to,livein
but,however,so,itis
your,father,thought,only,of,_them_,and,i,must,say,this,that
you,owe,no,particular,gratitude,to,him,nor,attention,to,his,wishes
for,we,very,well,know,that,if,he,could,he,would,have
left,almost,everything,in,the,world,to,_them,_,this,argument,was
irresistible
it,gave,to,his,intentions,whatever,of,decision,was,wanting,before,and
he,finally,resolved,that,it,would,be,absolutely,unnecessary,if,not,highly
indecorous,to,do,more,for,the,widow,and,children,of,his,father
than,such,kind,of,neighbourly,acts,as,his,own,wife,pointedout
chapter,iii,mrs,dashwood,remained,at,norland,several,months,not,from,any
disinclination,to,move,when,the,sight,of,every,well,known,spot,ceased
to,raise,the,violent,emotion,which,it,produced,for,a,while,for
when,her,spirits,began,to,revive,and,her,mind,became,capable,of
some,other,exertion,than,that,of,heightening,its,affliction,by,melancholy,remembrances

a,suitable,dwelling,in,the,neighbourhood,of,norland,for,to,remove,far
from,that,beloved,spot,wasimpossible
but,she,could,hear,of,no,situation,that,at,once,answered,her
notions,of,comfort,and,ease,and,suited,the,prudence,of,her,eldest
daughter,whose,steadier,judgment,rejected,several,houses,as,too,large,for,their
income,which,her,mother,would,haveapproved
illustration,_i,cannot,imagine,how,they,will,spend,half,of,it,_
mrs,dashwood,had,been,informed,by,her,husband,of,the,solemn,promise
on,the,part,of,his,son,in,their,favour,which,gave,comfort
to,his,last,earthlyreflections
she,doubted,the,sincerity,of,this,assurance,no,more,than,he,had
doubted,it,himself,and,she,thought,of,it,for,her,daughters,sake
with,satisfaction,though,as,for,herself,she,was,persuaded,that,a,much
smaller,provision,than,7000l,would,support,her,inaffluence
for,their,brother,s,sake,too,for,the,sake,of,his,own
heart,she,rejoiced,and,she,reproached,herself,for,being,unjust,to,his
merit,before,in,believing,him,incapable,ofgenerosity
his,attentive,behaviour,to,herself,and,his,sisters,convinced,her,that,their
welfare,was,dear,to,him,and,for,a,long,time,she,firmly
relied,on,the,liberality,of,hisintentions
the,contempt,which,she,had,very,early,in,their,acquaintance,felt,for
her,daughter,in,law,was,very,much,increased,by,the,farther,knowledge
of,her,character,which,half,a,year,s,residence,in,her,family
afforded,and,perhaps,in,spite,of,every,consideration,of,politeness,or,maternal
affection,on,the,side,of,the,former,the,two,ladies,might,have
found,it,impossible,to,have,lived,together,so,long,had,not,a
particular,circumstance,occurred,to,give,still,greater,eligibility,according,to,the,opinions
of,mrs,dashwood,to,her,daughters,continuance,atnorland
this,circumstance,was,a,growing,attachment,between,her,eldest,girl,and,the
brother,of,mrs,john,dashwood,a,gentlemanlike,and,pleasing,young,man,who
was,introduced,to,their,acquaintance,soon,after,his,sister,s,establishment,at
norland,and,who,had,since,spent,the,greatest,part,of,his,time
there
some,mothers,might,have,encouraged,the,intimacy,from,motives,of,interest,for
edward,ferrars,was,the,eldest,son,of,a,man,who,had,died
very,rich,and,some,might,have,repressed,it,from,motives,of,prudence
for,except,a,trifling,sum,the,whole,of,his,fortune,depended,on
the,will,of,hismother
but,mrs,dashwood,was,alike,uninfluenced,by,eitherconsideration
it,was,enough,for,her,that,he,appeared,to,be,amiable,that
he,loved,her,daughter,and,that,elinor,returned,thepartiality
it,was,contrary,to,every,doctrine,of,her,s,that,difference,of
fortune,should,keep,any,couple,asunder,who,were,attracted,by,resemblance,of
disposition,and,that,elinor,s,merit,should,not,be,acknowledged,by,every
one,who,knew,her,was,to,her,comprehensionimpossible
edward,ferrars,was,not,recommended,to,their,good,opinion,by,any,peculiar
graces,of,person,oraddress
he,was,not,handsome,and,his,manners,required,intimacy,to,make,them
pleasing
he,was,too,diffident,to,do,justice,to,himself,but,when,his
natural,shyness,was,overcome,his,behaviour,gave,every,indication,of,an,open
affectionateheart
his,understanding,was,good,and,his,education,had,given,it,solidimprovement
but,he,was,neither,fitted,by,abilities,nor,disposition,to,answer,the
wishes,of,his,mother,and,sister,who,longed,to,see,him,distinguished
as,they,hardly,knewwhat
they,wanted,him,to,make,a,fine,figure,in,the,world,in
some,manner,orother
his,mother,wished,to,interest,him,in,political,concerns,to,get,him
into,parliament,or,to,see,him,connected,with,some,of,the,great
men,of,theday
mrs,john,dashwood,wished,it,likewise,but,in,the,mean,while,till
one,of,these,superior,blessings,could,be,attained,it,would,have,quieted
her,ambition,to,see,him,driving,abarouche
but,edward,had,no,turn,for,great,men,orbarouches
all,his,wishes,centered,in,domestic,comfort,and,the,quiet,of,private
life
fortunately,he,had,a,younger,brother,who,was,morepromising
edward,had,been,staying,several,weeks,in,the,house,before,he,engaged
much,of,mrs,dashwood,s,attention,for,she,was,at,that,time
in,such,affliction,as,rendered,her,careless,of,surroundingobjects
she,saw,only,that,he,was,quiet,and,unobtrusive,and,she,liked
him,forit
he,did,not,disturb,the,wretchedness,of,her,mind,by,ill,timed
conversation
she,was,first,called,to,observe,and,approve,him,farther,by,a
reflection,which,elinor,chanced,one,day,to,make,on,the,difference,between
him,and,hissister
it,was,a,contrast,which,recommended,him,most,forcibly,to,hermother
it,is,enough,said,she,to,say,that,he,is,unlike,fanny
isenough
it,implies,everythingamiable
i,love,himalready
i,think,you,will,like,him,said,elinor,when,you,know,more
ofhim

i,feel,no,sentiment,of,approbation,inferior,tolove
you,may,esteemhim
i,have,never,yet,known,what,it,was,to,separate,esteem,and
love
mrs,dashwood,now,took,pains,to,get,acquainted,withhim
her,manners,were,attaching,and,soon,banished,hisreserve
she,speedily,comprehended,all,his,merits,the,persuasion,of,his,regard,for
elinor,perhaps,assisted,her,penetration,but,she,really,felt,assured,of,his
worth,and,even,that,quietness,of,manner,which,militated,against,all,her
established,ideas,of,what,a,young,man,s,address,ought,to,be
was,no,longer,uninteresting,when,she,knew,his,heart,to,be,warm
and,his,temperaffectionate
no,sooner,did,she,perceive,any,symptom,of,love,in,his,behaviour
to,elinor,than,she,considered,their,serious,attachment,as,certain,and,looked
forward,to,their,marriage,as,rapidlyapproaching
in,a,few,months,my,dear,marianne,said,she,elinor,will,in
all,probability,be,settled,forlife
we,shall,miss,her,but,_she_,will,behappy
oh
mamma,how,shall,we,do,withouther
my,love,it,will,be,scarcely,aseparation
we,shall,live,within,a,few,miles,of,each,other,and,shall
meet,every,day,of,ourlives
you,will,gain,a,brother,a,real,affectionatebrother
i,have,the,highest,opinion,in,the,world,of,edward,sheart
but,you,look,grave,marianne,do,you,disapprove,your,sister,schoice
perhaps,said,marianne,i,may,consider,it,with,somesurprise
edward,is,very,amiable,and,i,love,himtenderly
but,yet,he,is,not,the,kind,of,young,man,there,is
something,wanting,his,figure,is,not,striking,it,has,none,of,that
grace,which,i,should,expect,in,the,man,who,could,seriously,attach
mysister
his,eyes,want,all,that,spirit,that,fire,which,at,once,announce
virtue,andintelligence
and,besides,all,this,i,am,afraid,mamma,he,has,no,real
taste
music,seems,scarcely,to,attract,him,and,though,he,admires,elinor,s
drawings,very,much,it,is,not,the,admiration,of,a,person,who
can,understand,theirworth
it,is,evident,in,spite,of,his,frequent,attention,to,her,while
she,draws,that,in,fact,he,knows,nothing,of,thematter
he,admires,as,a,lover,not,as,aconnoisseur
to,satisfy,me,those,characters,must,beunited
i,could,not,be,happy,with,a,man,whose,taste,did,not
in,every,point,coincide,with,myown
he,must,enter,into,all,my,feelings,the,same,books,the,same
music,must,charm,usboth
oh
mama,how,spiritless,how,tame,was,edward,s,manner,in,reading,to
us,lastnight
i,felt,for,my,sister,mostseverely
yet,she,bore,it,with,so,much,composure,she,seemed,scarcely,to
noticeit
i,could,hardly,keep,myseat
to,hear,those,beautiful,lines,which,have,frequently,almost,driven,me,wild
pronounced,with,such,impenetrable,calmness,such,dreadfulindifference
he,would,certainly,have,done,more,justice,to,simple,and,elegantprose
i,thought,so,at,the,time,but,you,_would_,give,himcowper
nay,mamma,if,he,is,not,to,be,animated,by,cowper,but
we,must,allow,for,difference,oftaste
elinor,has,not,my,feelings,and,therefore,she,may,overlook,it,and
be,happy,withhim
but,it,would,have,broke,_my_,heart,had,i,loved,him,to
hear,him,read,with,so,littlesensibility
mama,the,more,i,know,of,the,world,the,more,am,i
convinced,that,i,shall,never,see,a,man,whom,i,can,really
love
i,require,somuch
he,must,have,all,edward,s,virtues,and,his,person,and,manners
must,ornament,his,goodness,with,every,possiblecharm
remember,my,love,that,you,are,notseventeen
it,is,yet,too,early,in,life,to,despair,of,such,a
happiness
why,should,you,be,less,fortunate,than,yourmother
in,one,circumstance,only,my,marianne,may,your,destiny,be,different,from
hers
chapter,iv,what,a,pity,it,is,elinor,said,marianne,that,edward
should,have,no,taste,fordrawing
no,taste,fordrawing
replied,elinor,why,should,you,thinkso
he,does,not,draw,himself,indeed,but,he,has,great,pleasure,in
seeing,the,performances,of,other,people,and,i,assure,you,he,is
by,no,means,deficient,in,natural,taste,though,he,has,not,had
opportunities,of,improvingit
had,he,ever,been,in,the,way,of,learning,i,think,he
would,have,drawn,verywell
he,distrusts,his,own,judgment,in,such,matters,so,much,that,he
is,always,unwilling,to,give,his,opinion,on,any,picture,but,he
has,an,innate,propriety,and,simplicity,of,taste,which,in,general,direct
him,perfectlyright
marianne,was,afraid,of,offending,and,said,no,more,on,the,subject
but,the,kind,of,approbation,which,elinor,described,as,excited,in,him
by,the,drawings,of,other,people,was,very,far,from,that,rapturous
delight,which,in,her,opinion,could,alone,be,calledtaste
yet,though,smiling,within,herself,at,the,mistake,she,honoured,her,sister
for,that,blind,partiality,to,edward,which,producedit
i,hope,marianne,continued,elinor,you,do,not,consider,him,as,deficient
in,generaltaste
indeed,i,think,i,may,say,that,you,cannot,for,your,behaviour
to,him,is,perfectly,cordial,and,if,_that_,were,your,opinion,i
am,sure,you,could,never,be,civil,tohim
marianne,hardly,knew,what,tosay
she,would,not,wound,the,feelings,of,her,sister,on,any,account
and,yet,to,say,what,she,did,not,believe,wasimpossible
at,length,she,replied,do,not,be,offended,elinor,if,my,praise
of,him,is,not,in,every,thing,equal,to,your,sense,of
hismerits
i,have,not,had,so,many,opportunities,of,estimating,the,minuter,propensities
of,his,mind,his,inclinations,and,tastes,as,you,have,but,i
have,the,highest,opinion,in,the,world,of,his,goodness,andsense
i,think,him,every,thing,that,is,worthy,andamiable
i,am,sure,replied,elinor,with,a,smile,that,his,dearest,friends
could,not,be,dissatisfied,with,such,commendation,asthat
i,do,not,perceive,how,you,could,express,yourself,morewarmly
marianne,was,rejoiced,to,find,her,sister,so,easilypleased
of,his,sense,and,his,goodness,continued,elinor,no,one,can,i
think,be,in,doubt,who,has,seen,him,often,enough,to,engage
him,in,unreservedconversation
the,excellence,of,his,understanding,and,his,principles,can,be,concealed,only
by,that,shyness,which,too,often,keeps,himsilent
you,know,enough,of,him,to,do,justice,to,his,solidworth
but,of,his,minuter,propensities,as,you,call,them,you,have,from
peculiar,circumstances,been,kept,more,ignorant,thanmyself
he,and,i,have,been,at,times,thrown,a,good,deal,together
while,you,have,been,wholly,engrossed,on,the,most,affectionate,principle,by
mymother
i,have,seen,a,great,deal,of,him,have,studied,his,sentiments
and,heard,his,opinion,on,subjects,of,literature,and,taste,and,upon
the,whole,i,venture,to,pronounce,that,his,mind,is,well,informed
enjoyment,of,books,exceedingly,great,his,imagination,lively,his,observation,just,and
correct,and,his,taste,delicate,andpure
his,abilities,in,every,respect,improve,as,much,upon,acquaintance,as,his
manners,andperson
at,first,sight,his,address,is,certainly,not,striking,and,his,person
can,hardly,be,called,handsome,till,the,expression,of,his,eyes,which
are,uncommonly,good,and,the,general,sweetness,of,his,countenance,isperceived
at,present,i,know,him,so,well,that,i,think,him,really
handsome,or,at,least,almostso
what,say,youmarianne
i,shall,very,soon,think,him,handsome,elinor,if,i,do,not
now
when,you,tell,me,to,love,him,as,a,brother,i,shall
no,more,see,imperfection,in,his,face,than,i,now,do,in
hisheart
elinor,started,at,this,declaration,and,was,sorry,for,the,warmth,she
had,been,betrayed,into,in,speaking,ofhim
she,felt,that,edward,stood,very,high,in,heropinion
she,believed,the,regard,to,be,mutual,but,she,required,greater,certainty
of,it,to,make,marianne,s,conviction,of,their,attachment,agreeable,to
her
she,knew,that,what,marianne,and,her,mother,conjectured,one,moment,they
believed,the,next,that,with,them,to,wish,was,to,hope,and
to,hope,was,toexpect
she,tried,to,explain,the,real,state,of,the,case,to,her
sister
i,do,not,attempt,to,deny,said,she,that,i,think,very
highly,of,him,that,i,greatly,esteem,that,i,likehim
marianne,here,burst,forth,with,indignation,esteemhim
likehim
cold,heartedelinor
oh
worse,than,coldhearted
ashamed,of,beingotherwise
use,those,words,again,and,i,will,leave,the,room,thismoment
elinor,could,not,helplaughing
excuse,me,said,she,and,be,assured,that,i,meant,no,offence
to,you,by,speaking,in,so,quiet,a,way,of,my,own
feelings
believe,them,to,be,stronger,than,i,have,declared,believe,them,in
short,to,be,such,as,his,merit,and,the,suspicion,the,hope
of,his,affection,for,me,may,warrant,without,imprudence,orfolly
but,farther,than,this,you,must,notbelieve
i,am,by,no,means,assured,of,his,regard,forme
there,are,moments,when,the,extent,of,it,seems,doubtful,and,till
his,sentiments,are,fully,known,you,cannot,wonder,at,my,wishing,to
avoid,any,encouragement,of,my,own,partiality,by,believing,or,calling,it
more,than,itis
in,my,heart,i,feel,little,scarcely,any,doubt,of,hispreference
but,there,are,other,points,to,be,considered,besides,hisinclination
he,is,very,far,from,beingindependent
what,his,mother,really,is,we,cannot,know,but,from,fanny,s
occasional,mention,of,her,conduct,and,opinions,we,have,never,been,disposed
to,think,her,amiable,and,i,am,very,much,mistaken,if,edward
is,not,himself,aware,that,there,would,be,many,difficulties,in,his
way,if,he,were,to,wish,to,marry,a,woman,who,had
not,either,a,great,fortune,or,highrank
marianne,was,astonished,to,find,how,much,the,imagination,of,her,mother
and,herself,had,outstripped,thetruth
and,you,really,are,not,engaged,tohim
saidshe
yet,it,certainly,soon,willhappen
but,two,advantages,will,proceed,from,thisdelay
i,shall,not,lose,you,so,soon,and,edward,will,have,greater
opportunity,of,improving,that,natural,taste,for,your,favourite,pursuit,which,must
be,so,indispensably,necessary,to,your,futurefelicity
oh
if,he,should,be,so,far,stimulated,by,your,genius,as,to
learn,to,draw,himself,how,delightful,it,wouldbe
elinor,had,given,her,real,opinion,to,hersister
she,could,not,consider,her,partiality,for,edward,in,so,prosperous,a
state,as,marianne,had,believedit
there,was,at,times,a,want,of,spirits,about,him,which,if
it,did,not,denote,indifference,spoke,of,something,almost,asunpromising
a,doubt,of,her,regard,supposing,him,to,feel,it,need,not
give,him,more,thaninquietude
it,would,not,be,likely,to,produce,that,dejection,of,mind,which
frequently,attendedhim
a,more,reasonable,cause,might,be,found,in,the,dependent,situation,which
forbade,the,indulgence,of,hisaffection
she,knew,that,his,mother,neither,behaved,to,him,so,as,to
make,his,home,comfortable,at,present,nor,to,give,him,any,assurance
that,he,might,form,a,home,for,himself,without,strictly,attending,to
her,views,for,hisaggrandizement
with,such,a,knowledge,as,this,it,was,impossible,for,elinor,to
feel,easy,on,thesubject
she,was,far,from,depending,on,that,result,of,his,preference,of
her,which,her,mother,and,sister,still,considered,ascertain
nay,the,longer,they,were,together,the,more,doubtful,seemed,the,nature
of,his,regard,and,sometimes,for,a,few,painful,minutes,she,believed
it,to,be,no,more,thanfriendship
but,whatever,might,really,be,its,limits,it,was,enough,when,perceived
by,his,sister,to,make,her,uneasy,and,at,the,same,time
which,was,still,more,common,to,make,heruncivil
she,took,the,first,opportunity,of,affronting,her,mother,in,law,on
the,occasion,talking,to,her,so,expressively,of,her,brother,s,great
expectations,of,mrs,ferrars,s,resolution,that,both,her,sons,should,marry
well,and,of,the,danger,attending,any,young,woman,who,attempted,to
_draw,him,in_,that,mrs,dashwood,could,neither,pretend,to,be,unconscious
nor,endeavor,to,becalm
she,gave,her,an,answer,which,marked,her,contempt,and,instantly,left
the,room,resolving,that,whatever,might,be,the,inconvenience,or,expense,of
so,sudden,a,removal,her,beloved,elinor,should,not,be,exposed,another
week,to,suchinsinuations
in,this,state,of,her,spirits,a,letter,was,delivered,to,her
from,the,post,which,contained,a,proposal,particularly,welltimed
it,was,the,offer,of,a,small,house,on,very,easy,terms
belonging,to,a,relation,of,her,own,a,gentleman,of,consequence,and
property,indevonshire
the,letter,was,from,this,gentleman,himself,and,written,in,the,true
spirit,of,friendlyaccommodation
he,understood,that,she,was,in,need,of,a,dwelling,and,though
the,house,he,now,offered,her,was,merely,a,cottage,he,assured
her,that,everything,should,be,done,to,it,which,she,might,think
necessary,if,the,situation,pleasedher
he,earnestly,pressed,her,after,giving,the,particulars,of,the,house,and
garden,to,come,with,her,daughters,to,barton,park,the,place,of
his,own,residence,from,whence,she,might,judge,herself,whether,barton,cottage
for,the,houses,were,in,the,same,parish,could,by,any,alteration
be,made,comfortable,toher
he,seemed,really,anxious,to,accommodate,them,and,the,whole,of,his
letter,was,written,in,so,friendly,a,style,as,could,not,fail
of,giving,pleasure,to,his,cousin,more,especially,at,a,moment,when
she,was,suffering,under,the,cold,and,unfeeling,behaviour,of,her,nearer
connections
she,needed,no,time,for,deliberation,orinquiry
her,resolution,was,formed,as,sheread
the,situation,of,barton,in,a,county,so,far,distant,from,sussex
as,devonshire,which,but,a,few,hours,before,would,have,been,a
sufficient,objection,to,outweigh,every,possible,advantage,belonging,to,the,place,was
now,its,firstrecommendation
to,quit,the,neighbourhood,of,norland,was,no,longer,an,evil,it
was,an,object,of,desire,it,was,a,blessing,in,comparison,of
the,misery,of,continuing,her,daughter,in,law,s,guest,and,to
remove,for,ever,from,that,beloved,place,would,be,less,painful,than
to,inhabit,or,visit,it,while,such,a,woman,was,itsmistress
she,instantly,wrote,sir,john,middleton,her,acknowledgment,of,his,kindness,and
her,acceptance,of,his,proposal,and,then,hastened,to,show,both,letters
to,her,daughters,that,she,might,be,secure,of,their,approbation,before
her,answer,weresent
elinor,had,always,thought,it,would,be,more,prudent,for,them,to
settle,at,some,distance,from,norland,than,immediately,amongst,their,presentacquaintance
on,_that_,head,therefore,it,was,not,for,her,to,oppose,her
mother,s,intention,of,removing,intodevonshire
the,house,too,as,described,by,sir,john,was,on,so,simple
a,scale,and,the,rent,so,uncommonly,moderate,as,to,leave,her
no,right,of,objection,on,either,point,and,therefore,though,it,was
not,a,plan,which,brought,any,charm,to,her,fancy,though,it
was,a,removal,from,the,vicinity,of,norland,beyond,her,wishes,she
made,no,attempt,to,dissuade,her,mother,from,sending,a,letter,of
acquiescence
chapter,v,no,sooner,was,her,answer,dispatched,than,mrs,dashwood,indulged
herself,in,the,pleasure,of,announcing,to,her,son,in,law,and
his,wife,that,she,was,provided,with,a,house,and,should,incommode
them,no,longer,than,till,every,thing,were,ready,for,her,inhabiting
it
they,heard,her,withsurprise
mrs,john,dashwood,said,nothing,but,her,husband,civilly,hoped,that,she
would,not,be,settled,far,fromnorland
she,had,great,satisfaction,in,replying,that,she,was,going,intodevonshire
edward,turned,hastily,towards,her,on,hearing,this,and,in,a,voice
of,surprise,and,concern,which,required,no,explanation,to,her,repeateddevonshire
are,you,indeed,goingthere
so,far,fromhence
and,to,what,part,ofit
she,explained,thesituation
it,was,within,four,miles,northward,ofexeter
it,is,but,a,cottage,she,continued,but,i,hope,to,see
many,of,my,friends,init
a,room,or,two,can,easily,be,added,and,if,my,friends
find,no,difficulty,in,travelling,so,far,to,see,me,i,am
sure,i,will,find,none,in,accommodatingthem
she,concluded,with,a,very,kind,invitation,to,mr,and,mrs,john
dashwood,to,visit,her,at,barton,and,to,edward,she,gave,one
with,still,greateraffection
though,her,late,conversation,with,her,daughter,in,law,had,made,her
resolve,on,remaining,at,norland,no,longer,than,was,unavoidable,it,had
not,produced,the,smallest,effect,on,her,in,that,point,to,which
it,principallytended
to,separate,edward,and,elinor,was,as,far,from,being,her,object
as,ever,and,she,wished,to,show,mrs,john,dashwood,by,this
pointed,invitation,to,her,brother,how,totally,she,disregarded,her,disapprobation,of
thematch
mr,john,dashwood,told,his,mother,again,and,again,how,exceedingly,sorry
he,was,that,she,had,taken,a,house,at,such,a,distance
from,norland,as,to,prevent,his,being,of,any,service,to,her
in,removing,herfurniture
he,really,felt,conscientiously,vexed,on,the,occasion,for,the,very,exertion
to,which,he,had,limited,the,performance,of,his,promise,to,his
father,was,by,this,arrangement,renderedimpracticable
the,furniture,was,all,sent,around,bywater
it,chiefly,consisted,of,household,linen,plate,china,and,books,with,a
handsome,pianoforte,of,mariannes
mrs,john,dashwood,saw,the,packages,depart,with,a,sigh,she,could
not,help,feeling,it,hard,that,as,mrs,dashwood,s,income,would
be,so,trifling,in,comparison,with,their,own,she,should,have,any
handsome,article,offurniture
mrs,dashwood,took,the,house,for,a,twelvemonth,it,was,ready,furnished
and,she,might,have,immediatepossession
no,difficulty,arose,on,either,side,in,the,agreement,and,she,waited
only,for,the,disposal,of,her,effects,at,norland,and,to,determine
her,future,household,before,she,set,off,for,the,west,and,this
as,she,was,exceedingly,rapid,in,the,performance,of,everything,that,interested
her,was,soondone
the,horses,which,were,left,her,by,her,husband,had,been,sold
soon,after,his,death,and,an,opportunity,now,offering,of,disposing,of
her,carriage,she,agreed,to,sell,that,likewise,at,the,earnest,advice
of,her,eldestdaughter
for,the,comfort,of,her,children,had,she,consulted,only,her,own
wishes,she,would,have,kept,it,but,the,discretion,of,elinorprevailed
_her_,wisdom,too,limited,the,number,of,their,servants,to,three,two
maids,and,a,man,with,whom,they,were,speedily,provided,from,amongst
those,who,had,formed,their,establishment,atnorland
the,man,and,one,of,the,maids,were,sent,off,immediately,into
devonshire,to,prepare,the,house,for,their,mistress,s,arrival,for,as
lady,middleton,was,entirely,unknown,to,mrs,dashwood,she,preferred,going,directly
to,the,cottage,to,being,a,visitor,at,barton,park,and,she
relied,so,undoubtingly,on,sir,john,s,description,of,the,house,as
to,feel,no,curiosity,to,examine,it,herself,till,she,entered,it
as,herown
her,eagerness,to,be,gone,from,norland,was,preserved,from,diminution,by
the,evident,satisfaction,of,her,daughter,in,law,in,the,prospect,of
her,removal,a,satisfaction,which,was,but,feebly,attempted,to,be,concealed
under,a,cold,invitation,to,her,to,defer,herdeparture
now,was,the,time,when,her,son,in,law,s,promise,to
his,father,might,with,particular,propriety,befulfilled
since,he,had,neglected,to,do,it,on,first,coming,to,the
estate,their,quitting,his,house,might,be,looked,on,as,the,most
suitable,period,for,itsaccomplishment
but,mrs,dashwood,began,shortly,to,give,over,every,hope,of,the
kind,and,to,be,convinced,from,the,general,drift,of,his,discourse
that,his,assistance,extended,no,farther,than,their,maintenance,for,six,months
atnorland
he,so,frequently,talked,of,the,increasing,expenses,of,housekeeping,and,of
the,perpetual,demands,upon,his,purse,which,a,man,of,any,consequence
in,the,world,was,beyond,calculation,exposed,to,that,he,seemed,rather
to,stand,in,need,of,more,money,himself,than,to,have,any
design,of,giving,moneyaway
in,a,very,few,weeks,from,the,day,which,brought,sir,john
middleton,s,first,letter,to,norland,every,thing,was,so,far,settled
in,their,future,abode,as,to,enable,mrs,dashwood,and,her,daughters
to,begin,theirjourney

a,place,so,muchbeloved

chapter,vi,the,first,part,of,their,journey,was,performed,in,too
melancholy,a,disposition,to,be,otherwise,than,tedious,andunpleasant
but,as,they,drew,towards,the,end,of,it,their,interest,in
the,appearance,of,a,country,which,they,were,to,inhabit,overcame,their
dejection,and,a,view,of,barton,valley,as,they,entered,it,gave
themcheerfulness
it,was,a,pleasant,fertile,spot,well,wooded,and,rich,inpasture
after,winding,along,it,for,more,than,a,mile,they,reached,their
ownhouse
a,small,green,court,was,the,whole,of,its,demesne,in,front
and,a,neat,wicket,gate,admitted,them,intoit
as,a,house,barton,cottage,though,small,was,comfortable,and,compact,but
as,a,cottage,it,was,defective,for,the,building,was,regular,the
roof,was,tiled,the,window,shutters,were,not,painted,green,nor,were
the,walls,covered,withhoneysuckles
a,narrow,passage,led,directly,through,the,house,into,the,gardenbehind
on,each,side,of,the,entrance,was,a,sitting,room,about,sixteen
feet,square,and,beyond,them,were,the,offices,and,thestairs
four,bedrooms,and,two,garrets,formed,the,rest,of,thehouse
it,had,not,been,built,many,years,and,was,in,goodrepair
in,comparison,of,norland,it,was,poor,and,small,indeed,but,the
tears,which,recollection,called,forth,as,they,entered,the,house,were,soon
driedaway
they,were,cheered,by,the,joy,of,the,servants,on,their,arrival
and,each,for,the,sake,of,the,others,resolved,to,appearhappy
it,was,very,early,in,september,the,season,was,fine,and,from
first,seeing,the,place,under,the,advantage,of,good,weather,they,received
an,impression,in,its,favour,which,was,of,material,service,in,recommending
it,to,their,lastingapprobation
the,situation,of,the,house,wasgood
high,hills,rose,immediately,behind,and,at,no,great,distance,on,each
side,some,of,which,were,open,downs,the,others,cultivated,andwoody
the,village,of,barton,was,chiefly,on,one,of,these,hills,and
formed,a,pleasant,view,from,the,cottagewindows
the,prospect,in,front,was,more,extensive,it,commanded,the,whole,of
the,valley,and,reached,into,the,countrybeyond
the,hills,which,surrounded,the,cottage,terminated,the,valley,in,that,direction
under,another,name,and,in,another,course,it,branched,out,again,between
two,of,the,steepest,ofthem
with,the,size,and,furniture,of,the,house,mrs,dashwood,was,upon
the,whole,well,satisfied,for,though,her,former,style,of,life,rendered
many,additions,to,the,latter,indispensable,yet,to,add,and,improve,was
a,delight,to,her,and,she,had,at,this,time,ready,money
enough,to,supply,all,that,was,wanted,of,greater,elegance,to,the
apartments
as,for,the,house,itself,to,be,sure,said,she,it,is
too,small,for,our,family,but,we,will,make,ourselves,tolerably,comfortable
for,the,present,as,it,is,too,late,in,the,year,for
improvements
perhaps,in,the,spring,if,i,have,plenty,of,money,as,i
dare,say,i,shall,we,may,think,aboutbuilding
these,parlors,are,both,too,small,for,such,parties,of,our,friends
as,i,hope,to,see,often,collected,here,and,i,have,some
thoughts,of,throwing,the,passage,into,one,of,them,with,perhaps,a
part,of,the,other,and,so,leave,the,remainder,of,that,other
for,an,entrance,this,with,a,new,drawing,room,which,may,be
easily,added,and,a,bed,chamber,and,garret,above,will,make,it

in,the,spring,and,we,will,plan,our,improvementsaccordingly
in,the,mean,time,till,all,these,alterations,could,be,made,from
the,savings,of,an,income,of,five,hundred,a,year,by,a
woman,who,never,saved,in,her,life,they,were,wise,enough,to
be,contented,with,the,house,as,it,was,and,each,of,them
was,busy,in,arranging,their,particular,concerns,and,endeavoring,by,placing,around
them,books,and,other,possessions,to,form,themselves,ahome
marianne,s,pianoforte,was,unpacked,and,properly,disposed,of,and,elinor,s
drawings,were,affixed,to,the,walls,of,their,sittingroom
in,such,employments,as,these,they,were,interrupted,soon,after,breakfast,the
next,day,by,the,entrance,of,their,landlord,who,called,to,welcome
them,to,barton,and,to,offer,them,every,accommodation,from,his,own
house,and,garden,in,which,theirs,might,at,present,bedeficient
sir,john,middleton,was,a,good,looking,man,aboutforty
he,had,formerly,visited,at,stanhill,but,it,was,too,long,for
his,young,cousins,to,rememberhim
his,countenance,was,thoroughly,good,humoured,and,his,manners,were,as,friendly
as,the,style,of,hisletter
their,arrival,seemed,to,afford,him,real,satisfaction,and,their,comfort,to
be,an,object,of,real,solicitude,tohim
he,said,much,of,his,earnest,desire,of,their,living,in,the
most,sociable,terms,with,his,family,and,pressed,them,so,cordially,to
dine,at,barton,park,every,day,till,they,were,better,settled,at
home,that,though,his,entreaties,were,carried,to,a,point,of,perseverance
beyond,civility,they,could,not,giveoffence
his,kindness,was,not,confined,to,words,for,within,an,hour,after
he,left,them,a,large,basket,full,of,garden,stuff,and,fruit
arrived,from,the,park,which,was,followed,before,the,end,of,the
day,by,a,present,ofgame
he,insisted,moreover,on,conveying,all,their,letters,to,and,from,the
post,for,them,and,would,not,be,denied,the,satisfaction,of,sending
them,his,newspaper,everyday
lady,middleton,had,sent,a,very,civil,message,by,him,denoting,her
intention,of,waiting,on,mrs,dashwood,as,soon,as,she,could,be
assured,that,her,visit,would,be,no,inconvenience,and,as,this,message
was,answered,by,an,invitation,equally,polite,her,ladyship,was,introduced,to
them,the,nextday
illustration,_so,shy,before,company,_,they,were,of,course,very,anxious
to,see,a,person,on,whom,so,much,of,their,comfort,at
barton,must,depend,and,the,elegance,of,her,appearance,was,favourable,to
theirwishes
lady,middleton,was,not,more,than,six,or,seven,and,twenty,her
face,was,handsome,her,figure,tall,and,striking,and,her,addressgraceful
her,manners,had,all,the,elegance,which,her,husband,swanted
but,they,would,have,been,improved,by,some,share,of,his,frankness
and,warmth,and,her,visit,was,long,enough,to,detract,something,from
their,first,admiration,by,showing,that,though,perfectly,well,bred,she,was
reserved,cold,and,had,nothing,to,say,for,herself,beyond,the,most
common,place,inquiry,orremark
conversation,however,was,not,wanted,for,sir,john,was,very,chatty,and
lady,middleton,had,taken,the,wise,precaution,of,bringing,with,her,their
eldest,child,a,fine,little,boy,about,six,years,old,by,which
means,there,was,one,subject,always,to,be,recurred,to,by,the
ladies,in,case,of,extremity,for,they,had,to,enquire,his,name
and,age,admire,his,beauty,and,ask,him,questions,which,his,mother
answered,for,him,while,he,hung,about,her,and,held,down,his
head,to,the,great,surprise,of,her,ladyship,who,wondered,at,his
being,so,shy,before,company,as,he,could,make,noise,enough,at
home
on,every,formal,visit,a,child,ought,to,be,of,the,party
by,way,of,provision,fordiscourse
in,the,present,case,it,took,up,ten,minutes,to,determine,whether
the,boy,were,most,like,his,father,or,mother,and,in,what
particular,he,resembled,either,for,of,course,every,body,differed,and,every
body,was,astonished,at,the,opinion,of,theothers
an,opportunity,was,soon,to,be,given,to,the,dashwoods,of,debating
on,the,rest,of,the,children,as,sir,john,would,not,leave
the,house,without,securing,their,promise,of,dining,at,the,park,the
nextday
chapter,vii,barton,park,was,about,half,a,mile,from,thecottage
the,ladies,had,passed,near,it,in,their,way,along,the,valley
but,it,was,screened,from,their,view,at,home,by,the,projection
of,ahill
the,house,was,large,and,handsome,and,the,middletons,lived,in,a
style,of,equal,hospitality,andelegance
the,former,was,for,sir,john,s,gratification,the,latter,for,that
of,hislady
they,were,scarcely,ever,without,some,friends,staying,with,them,in,the
house,and,they,kept,more,company,of,every,kind,than,any,other
family,in,theneighbourhood
it,was,necessary,to,the,happiness,of,both,for,however,dissimilar,in
temper,and,outward,behaviour,they,strongly,resembled,each,other,in,that,total
want,of,talent,and,taste,which,confined,their,employments,unconnected,with,such
as,society,produced,within,a,very,narrowcompass
sir,john,was,a,sportsman,lady,middleton,amother
he,hunted,and,shot,and,she,humoured,her,children,and,these,were
their,onlyresources
lady,middleton,had,the,advantage,of,being,able,to,spoil,her,children
all,the,year,round,while,sir,john,s,independent,employments,were,in
existence,only,half,thetime
continual,engagements,at,home,and,abroad,however,supplied,all,the,deficiencies,of
nature,and,education,supported,the,good,spirits,of,sir,john,and,gave
exercise,to,the,good,breeding,of,hiswife
lady,middleton,piqued,herself,upon,the,elegance,of,her,table,and,of
all,her,domestic,arrangements,and,from,this,kind,of,vanity,was,her
greatest,enjoyment,in,any,of,theirparties
but,sir,john,s,satisfaction,in,society,was,much,more,real,he
delighted,in,collecting,about,him,more,young,people,than,his,house,would
hold,and,the,noisier,they,were,the,better,was,hepleased
he,was,a,blessing,to,all,the,juvenile,part,of,the,neighbourhood
for,in,summer,he,was,for,ever,forming,parties,to,eat,cold
ham,and,chicken,out,of,doors,and,in,winter,his,private,balls
were,numerous,enough,for,any,young,lady,who,was,not,suffering,under
the,insatiable,appetite,offifteen
the,arrival,of,a,new,family,in,the,country,was,always,a
matter,of,joy,to,him,and,in,every,point,of,view,he
was,charmed,with,the,inhabitants,he,had,now,procured,for,his,cottage
atbarton
the,miss,dashwoods,were,young,pretty,andunaffected
it,was,enough,to,secure,his,good,opinion,for,to,be,unaffected
was,all,that,a,pretty,girl,could,want,to,make,her,mind
as,captivating,as,herperson
the,friendliness,of,his,disposition,made,him,happy,in,accommodating,those,whose
situation,might,be,considered,in,comparison,with,the,past,asunfortunate
in,showing,kindness,to,his,cousins,therefore,he,had,the,real,satisfaction
of,a,good,heart,and,in,settling,a,family,of,females,only
in,his,cottage,he,had,all,the,satisfaction,of,a,sportsman,for
a,sportsman,though,he,esteems,only,those,of,his,sex,who,are
sportsmen,likewise,is,not,often,desirous,of,encouraging,their,taste,by,admitting
them,to,a,residence,within,his,ownmanor
mrs,dashwood,and,her,daughters,were,met,at,the,door,of,the
house,by,sir,john,who,welcomed,them,to,barton,park,with,unaffected
sincerity,and,as,he,attended,them,to,the,drawing,room,repeated,to
the,young,ladies,the,concern,which,the,same,subject,had,drawn,from
him,the,day,before,at,being,unable,to,get,any,smart,young
men,to,meetthem
they,would,see,he,said,only,one,gentleman,there,besides,himself,a
particular,friend,who,was,staying,at,the,park,but,who,was,neither
very,young,nor,verygay
he,hoped,they,would,all,excuse,the,smallness,of,the,party,and
could,assure,them,it,should,never,happen,soagain
he,had,been,to,several,families,that,morning,in,hopes,of,procuring
some,addition,to,their,number,but,it,was,moonlight,and,every,body
was,full,ofengagements
luckily,lady,middleton,s,mother,had,arrived,at,barton,within,the,last
hour,and,as,she,was,a,very,cheerful,agreeable,woman,he,hoped
the,young,ladies,would,not,find,it,so,very,dull,as,they
mightimagine
the,young,ladies,as,well,as,their,mother,were,perfectly,satisfied,with
having,two,entire,strangers,of,the,party,and,wished,for,nomore
mrs,jennings,lady,middleton,s,mother,was,a,good,humoured,merry,fat
elderly,woman,who,talked,a,great,deal,seemed,very,happy,and,rather
vulgar
she,was,full,of,jokes,and,laughter,and,before,dinner,was,over
had,said,many,witty,things,on,the,subject,of,lovers,and,husbands
hoped,they,had,not,left,their,hearts,behind,them,in,sussex,and
pretended,to,see,them,blush,whether,they,did,ornot
marianne,was,vexed,at,it,for,her,sister,s,sake,and,turned
her,eyes,towards,elinor,to,see,how,she,bore,these,attacks,with
an,earnestness,which,gave,elinor,far,more,pain,than,could,arise,from
such,common,place,raillery,as,mrs,jenningss
colonel,brandon,the,friend,of,sir,john,seemed,no,more,adapted,by
resemblance,of,manner,to,be,his,friend,than,lady,middleton,was,to
be,his,wife,or,mrs,jennings,to,be,lady,middleton,smother
he,was,silent,andgrave
his,appearance,however,was,not,unpleasing,in,spite,of,his,being,in
the,opinion,of,marianne,and,margaret,an,absolute,old,bachelor,for,he
was,on,the,wrong,side,of,five,and,thirty,but,though,his
face,was,not,handsome,his,countenance,was,sensible,and,his,address,was
particularlygentlemanlike
there,was,nothing,in,any,of,the,party,which,could,recommend,them
as,companions,to,the,dashwoods,but,the,cold,insipidity,of,lady,middleton
was,so,particularly,repulsive,that,in,comparison,of,it,the,gravity,of
colonel,brandon,and,even,the,boisterous,mirth,of,sir,john,and,his
mother,in,law,wasinteresting
lady,middleton,seemed,to,be,roused,to,enjoyment,only,by,the,entrance
of,her,four,noisy,children,after,dinner,who,pulled,her,about,tore
her,clothes,and,put,an,end,to,every,kind,of,discourse,except
what,related,tothemselves
in,the,evening,as,marianne,was,discovered,to,be,musical,she,was
invited,toplay
the,instrument,was,unlocked,every,body,prepared,to,be,charmed,and,marianne
who,sang,very,well,at,their,request,went,through,the,chief,of
the,songs,which,lady,middleton,had,brought,into,the,family,on,her
marriage,and,which,perhaps,had,lain,ever,since,in,the,same,position
on,the,pianoforte,for,her,ladyship,had,celebrated,that,event,by,giving
up,music,although,by,her,mother,s,account,she,had,played,extremely
well,and,by,her,own,was,very,fond,ofit
marianne,s,performance,was,highlyapplauded
sir,john,was,loud,in,his,admiration,at,the,end,of,every
song,and,as,loud,in,his,conversation,with,the,others,while,every
songlasted
lady,middleton,frequently,called,him,to,order,wondered,how,any,one,s
attention,could,be,diverted,from,music,for,a,moment,and,asked,marianne
to,sing,a,particular,song,which,marianne,had,justfinished
colonel,brandon,alone,of,all,the,party,heard,her,without,being,in
raptures
he,paid,her,only,the,compliment,of,attention,and,she,felt,a
respect,for,him,on,the,occasion,which,the,others,had,reasonably,forfeited
by,their,shameless,want,oftaste
his,pleasure,in,music,though,it,amounted,not,to,that,ecstatic,delight
which,alone,could,sympathize,with,her,own,was,estimable,when,contrasted,against
the,horrible,insensibility,of,the,others,and,she,was,reasonable,enough,to
allow,that,a,man,of,five,and,thirty,might,well,have,outlived
all,acuteness,of,feeling,and,every,exquisite,power,ofenjoyment
she,was,perfectly,disposed,to,make,every,allowance,for,the,colonel,s
advanced,state,of,life,which,humanityrequired
chapter,viii,mrs,jennings,was,a,widow,with,an,amplejointure
she,had,only,two,daughters,both,of,whom,she,had,lived,to
see,respectably,married,and,she,had,now,therefore,nothing,to,do,but
to,marry,all,the,rest,of,theworld
in,the,promotion,of,this,object,she,was,zealously,active,as,far
as,her,ability,reached,and,missed,no,opportunity,of,projecting,weddings,among
all,the,young,people,of,heracquaintance
she,was,remarkably,quick,in,the,discovery,of,attachments,and,had,enjoyed
the,advantage,of,raising,the,blushes,and,the,vanity,of,many,a
young,lady,by,insinuations,of,her,power,over,such,a,young,man
and,this,kind,of,discernment,enabled,her,soon,after,her,arrival,at
barton,decisively,to,pronounce,that,colonel,brandon,was,very,much,in,love
with,mariannedashwood
she,rather,suspected,it,to,be,so,on,the,very,first,evening
of,their,being,together,from,his,listening,so,attentively,while,she,sang
to,them,and,when,the,visit,was,returned,by,the,middletons,dining
at,the,cottage,the,fact,was,ascertained,by,his,listening,to,her
again
it,must,beso
she,was,perfectly,convinced,ofit
it,would,be,an,excellent,match,for,_he_,was,rich,and,_she_
washandsome
mrs,jennings,had,been,anxious,to,see,colonel,brandon,well,married,ever
since,her,connection,with,sir,john,first,brought,him,to,her,knowledge
and,she,was,always,anxious,to,get,a,good,husband,for,every
prettygirl
the,immediate,advantage,to,herself,was,by,no,means,inconsiderable,for,it
supplied,her,with,endless,jokes,against,themboth
at,the,park,she,laughed,at,the,colonel,and,in,the,cottage
atmarianne
to,the,former,her,raillery,was,probably,as,far,as,it,regarded
only,himself,perfectly,indifferent,but,to,the,latter,it,was,at,first
incomprehensible,and,when,its,object,was,understood,she,hardly,knew,whether,most
to,laugh,at,its,absurdity,or,censure,its,impertinence,for,she,considered
it,as,an,unfeeling,reflection,on,the,colonel,s,advanced,years,and
on,his,forlorn,condition,as,an,oldbachelor
mrs,dashwood,who,could,not,think,a,man,five,years,younger,than
herself,so,exceedingly,ancient,as,he,appeared,to,the,youthful,fancy,of
her,daughter,ventured,to,clear,mrs,jennings,from,the,probability,of,wishing
to,throw,ridicule,on,hisage
but,at,least,mamma,you,cannot,deny,the,absurdity,of,the,accusation

of,society,for,her,children,and,she,was,resolute,in,declining,to
visit,any,family,beyond,the,distance,of,awalk
there,were,but,few,who,could,be,so,classed,and,it,was
not,all,of,them,that,wereattainable

ancient,respectable,looking,mansion,which,by,reminding,them,a,little,of,norland
interested,their,imagination,and,made,them,wish,to,be,better,acquainted,with
it
but,they,learnt,on,enquiry,that,its,possessor,an,elderly,lady,of
very,good,character,was,unfortunately,too,infirm,to,mix,with,the,world
and,never,stirred,fromhome

a,happy,alternative,when,the,dirt,of,the,valleys,beneath,shut,up
their,superior,beauties,and,towards,one,of,these,hills,did,marianne,and

of,a,showery,sky,and,unable,longer,to,bear,the,confinement,which
the,settled,rain,of,the,two,preceding,days,hadoccasioned
the,weather,was,not,tempting,enough,to,draw,the,two,others,from
their,pencil,and,their,book,in,spite,of,marianne,s,declaration,that
the,day,would,be,lastingly,fair,and,that,every,threatening,cloud,would
be,drawn,off,from,their,hills,and,the,two,girls,set,off
together

glimpse,of,blue,sky,and,when,they,caught,in,their,faces,the
animating,gales,of,a,high,south,westerly,wind,they,pitied,the,fears

united,over,their,heads,and,a,driving,rain,set,full,in,their
face

no,shelter,was,nearer,than,their,ownhouse
one,consolation,however,remained,for,them,to,which,the,exigence,of,the
moment,gave,more,than,usual,propriety,it,was,that,of,running,with
all,possible,speed,down,the,steep,side,of,the,hill,which,led
immediately,to,their,gardengate

suddenly,to,the,ground,and,margaret,unable,to,stop,herself,to,assist
her,was,involuntarily,hurried,along,and,reached,the,bottom,insafety
a,gentleman,carrying,a,gun,with,two,pointers,playing,round,him,was
passing,up,the,hill,and,within,a,few,yards,of,marianne,when
her,accidenthappened
he,put,down,his,gun,and,ran,to,herassistance
she,had,raised,herself,from,the,ground,but,her,foot,had,been
twisted,in,her,fall,and,she,was,scarcely,able,tostand
the,gentleman,offered,his,services,and,perceiving,that,her,modesty,declined,what
her,situation,rendered,necessary,took,her,up,in,his,arms,without,farther
delay,and,carried,her,down,thehill
then,passing,through,the,garden,the,gate,of,which,had,been,left
open,by,margaret,he,bore,her,directly,into,the,house,whither,margaret
was,just,arrived,and,quitted,not,his,hold,till,he,had,seated
her,in,a,chair,in,theparlour
elinor,and,her,mother,rose,up,in,amazement,at,their,entrance,and
while,the,eyes,of,both,were,fixed,on,him,with,an,evident
wonder,and,a,secret,admiration,which,equally,sprung,from,his,appearance,he
apologized,for,his,intrusion,by,relating,its,cause,in,a,manner,so
frank,and,so,graceful,that,his,person,which,was,uncommonly,handsome,received
additional,charms,from,his,voice,andexpression
had,he,been,even,old,ugly,and,vulgar,the,gratitude,and,kindness
of,mrs,dashwood,would,have,been,secured,by,any,act,of,attention
to,her,child,but,the,influence,of,youth,beauty,and,elegance,gave
an,interest,to,the,action,which,came,home,to,herfeelings
she,thanked,him,again,and,again,and,with,a,sweetness,of,address
which,always,attended,her,invited,him,to,beseated
but,this,he,declined,as,he,was,dirty,andwet

calling,tomorrow,to,enquire,after,missdashwood
the,honour,was,readily,granted,and,he,then,departed,to,make,himself
still,more,interesting,in,the,midst,of,a,heavyrain
his,manly,beauty,and,more,than,common,gracefulness,were,instantly,the,theme
of,general,admiration,and,the,laugh,which,his,gallantry,raised,against,marianne
received,particular,spirit,from,his,exteriorattractions
marianne,herself,had,seen,less,of,his,person,than,the,rest,for
the,confusion,which,crimsoned,over,her,face,on,his,lifting,her,up
had,robbed,her,of,the,power,of,regarding,him,after,their,entering
thehouse
but,she,had,seen,enough,of,him,to,join,in,all,the
admiration,of,the,others,and,with,an,energy,which,always,adorned,her
praise
his,person,and,air,were,equal,to,what,her,fancy,had,ever
drawn,for,the,hero,of,a,favourite,story,and,in,his,carrying
her,into,the,house,with,so,little,previous,formality,there,was,a
rapidity,of,thought,which,particularly,recommended,the,action,toher
every,circumstance,belonging,to,him,wasinteresting
his,name,was,good,his,residence,was,in,their,favourite,village,and
she,soon,found,out,that,of,all,manly,dresses,a,shooting,jacket
was,the,mostbecoming
her,imagination,was,busy,her,reflections,were,pleasant,and,the,pain,of
a,sprained,ankle,wasdisregarded

saidelinor

told,them,that,mr,willoughby,had,no,property,of,his,own,in
the,country,that,he,resided,there,only,while,he,was,visiting,the
old,lady,at,allenham,court,to,whom,he,was,related,and,whose

miss,marianne,must,not,expect,to,have,all,the,men,toherself
brandon,will,be,jealous,if,she,does,not,takecare
i,do,not,believe,said,mrs,dashwood,with,a,good,humoured,smile

that,is,an,expression,sir,john,said,marianne,warmly,which,i,particularly
dislike
i,abhor,every,common,place,phrase,by,which,wit,is,intended,and
setting,one,s,cap,at,a,man,or,making,a,conquest,are
the,most,odious,ofall
their,tendency,is,gross,and,illiberal,and,if,their,construction,could,ever
be,deemed,clever,time,has,long,ago,destroyed,all,itsingenuity
sir,john,did,not,much,understand,this,reproof,but,he,laughed,as
heartily,as,if,he,did,and,then,replied,ay,you,will,make

her,form,though,not,so,correct,as,her,sister,s,in,having
the,advantage,of,height,was,more,striking,and,her,face,was,so
lovely,that,when,in,the,common,cant,of,praise,she,was,called
a,beautiful,girl,truth,was,less,violently,outraged,than,usuallyhappens
her,skin,was,very,brown,but,from,its,transparency,her,complexion,was
uncommonly,brilliant,her,features,were,all,good,her,smile,was,sweet,and
attractive,and,in,her,eyes,which,were,very,dark,there,was,a
life,a,spirit,an,eagerness,which,could,hardily,be,seen,withoutdelight

which,the,remembrance,of,his,assistancecreated

saw,that,to,the,perfect,good,breeding,of,the,gentleman,he,united
frankness,and,vivacity,and,above,all,when,she,heard,him,declare,that
of,music,and,dancing,he,was,passionately,fond,she,gave,him,such
a,look,of,approbation,as,secured,the,largest,share,of,his,discourse

sir,john,had,dropped,hints,of,past,injuries,and,disappointments,which,justified
her,belief,of,his,being,an,unfortunate,man,and,she,regarded,him

their,time,as,shortly,presented,themselves,or,that,they,should,have,such
frequent,invitations,and,such,constant,visitors,as,to,leave,them,little,leisure
for,seriousemployment
yet,such,was,thecase
when,marianne,was,recovered,the,schemes,of,amusement,at,home,and,abroad
which,sir,john,had,been,previously,forming,were,put,intoexecution
the,private,balls,at,the,park,then,began,and,parties,on,the
water,were,made,and,accomplished,as,often,as,a,showery,october,would
allow
in,every,meeting,of,the,kind,willoughby,was,included,and,the,ease
and,familiarity,which,naturally,attended,these,parties,were,exactly,calculated,to,give
increasing,intimacy,to,his,acquaintance,with,the,dashwoods,to,afford,him,opportunity
of,witnessing,the,excellencies,of,marianne,of,marking,his,animated,admiration,of
her,and,of,receiving,in,her,behaviour,to,himself,the,most,pointed
assurance,of,heraffection
elinor,could,not,be,surprised,at,theirattachment
she,only,wished,that,it,were,less,openly,shown,and,once,or
twice,did,venture,to,suggest,the,propriety,of,some,self,command,to
marianne
but,marianne,abhorred,all,concealment,where,no,real,disgrace,could,attend,unreserve
and,to,aim,at,the,restraint,of,sentiments,which,were,not,in
themselves,illaudable,appeared,to,her,not,merely,an,unnecessary,effort,but,a
disgraceful,subjection,of,reason,to,common,place,and,mistakennotions
willoughby,thought,the,same,and,their,behaviour,at,all,times,was,an
illustration,of,theiropinions
when,he,was,present,she,had,no,eyes,for,any,oneelse
every,thing,he,did,wasright
every,thing,he,said,wasclever
if,their,evenings,at,the,park,were,concluded,with,cards,he,cheated
himself,and,all,the,rest,of,the,party,to,get,her,a
goodhand
if,dancing,formed,the,amusement,of,the,night,they,were,partners,for
half,the,time,and,when,obliged,to,separate,for,a,couple,of
dances,were,careful,to,stand,together,and,scarcely,spoke,a,word,to
any,bodyelse
such,conduct,made,them,of,course,most,exceedingly,laughed,at,but,ridicule
could,not,shame,and,seemed,hardly,to,provokethem
mrs,dashwood,entered,into,all,their,feelings,with,a,warmth,which,left
her,no,inclination,for,checking,this,excessive,display,ofthem
to,her,it,was,but,the,natural,consequence,of,a,strong,affection
in,a,young,and,ardentmind
this,was,the,season,of,happiness,tomarianne
her,heart,was,devoted,to,willoughby,and,the,fond,attachment,to,norland
which,she,brought,with,her,from,sussex,was,more,likely,to,be
softened,than,she,had,thought,it,possible,before,by,the,charms,which
his,society,bestowed,on,her,presenthome
elinor,s,happiness,was,not,sogreat
her,heart,was,not,so,much,at,ease,nor,her,satisfaction,in
their,amusements,sopure
they,afforded,her,no,companion,that,could,make,amends,for,what,she
had,left,behind,nor,that,could,teach,her,to,think,of,norland
with,less,regret,thanever
neither,lady,middleton,nor,mrs,jennings,could,supply,to,her,the,conversation
she,missed,although,the,latter,was,an,everlasting,talker,and,from,the
first,had,regarded,her,with,a,kindness,which,ensured,her,a,large
share,of,herdiscourse
she,had,already,repeated,her,own,history,to,elinor,three,or,four
times,and,had,elinor,s,memory,been,equal,to,her,means,of
improvement,she,might,have,known,very,early,in,their,acquaintance,all,the
particulars,of,mr,jennings,s,last,illness,and,what,he,said,to
his,wife,a,few,minutes,before,hedied
lady,middleton,was,more,agreeable,than,her,mother,only,in,being,more
silent
elinor,needed,little,observation,to,perceive,that,her,reserve,was,a,mere
calmness,of,manner,with,which,sense,had,nothing,todo
towards,her,husband,and,mother,she,was,the,same,as,to,them
and,intimacy,was,therefore,neither,to,be,looked,for,nordesired
she,had,nothing,to,say,one,day,that,she,had,not,said
the,daybefore
her,insipidity,was,invariable,for,even,her,spirits,were,always,the,same
and,though,she,did,not,oppose,the,parties,arranged,by,her,husband
provided,every,thing,were,conducted,in,style,and,her,two,eldest,children
attended,her,she,never,appeared,to,receive,more,enjoyment,from,them,than
she,might,have,experienced,in,sitting,at,home,and,so,little,did
her,presence,add,to,the,pleasure,of,the,others,by,any,share
in,their,conversation,that,they,were,sometimes,only,reminded,of,her,being
amongst,them,by,her,solicitude,about,her,troublesomeboys
in,colonel,brandon,alone,of,all,her,new,acquaintance,did,elinor,find
a,person,who,could,in,any,degree,claim,the,respect,of,abilities
excite,the,interest,of,friendship,or,give,pleasure,as,acompanion
willoughby,was,out,of,thequestion
her,admiration,and,regard,even,her,sisterly,regard,was,all,his,own
but,he,was,a,lover,his,attentions,were,wholly,marianne,s,and
a,far,less,agreeable,man,might,have,been,more,generallypleasing
colonel,brandon,unfortunately,for,himself,had,no,such,encouragement,to,think,only
of,marianne,and,in,conversing,with,elinor,he,found,the,greatest,consolation
for,the,indifference,of,hersister
elinor,s,compassion,for,him,increased,as,she,had,reason,to,suspect
that,the,misery,of,disappointed,love,had,already,been,known,tohim
this,suspicion,was,given,by,some,words,which,accidentally,dropped,from,him
one,evening,at,the,park,when,they,were,sitting,down,together,by
mutual,consent,while,the,others,weredancing
his,eyes,were,fixed,on,marianne,and,after,a,silence,of,some
minutes,he,said,with,a,faint,smile,your,sister,i,understand,does
not,approve,of,secondattachments
no,replied,elinor,her,opinions,are,allromantic
or,rather,as,i,believe,she,considers,them,impossible,toexist
i,believe,shedoes
but,how,she,contrives,it,without,reflecting,on,the,character,of,her
own,father,who,had,himself,two,wives,i,knownot
a,few,years,however,will,settle,her,opinions,on,the,reasonable,basis
of,common,sense,and,observation,and,then,they,may,be,more,easy
to,define,and,to,justify,than,they,now,are,by,any,body
butherself
this,will,probably,be,the,case,he,replied,and,yet,there,is
something,so,amiable,in,the,prejudices,of,a,young,mind,that,one
is,sorry,to,see,them,give,way,to,the,reception,of,more
generalopinions
i,cannot,agree,with,you,there,saidelinor
there,are,inconveniences,attending,such,feelings,as,marianne,s,which,all,the
charms,of,enthusiasm,and,ignorance,of,the,world,cannot,atonefor

and,a,better,acquaintance,with,the,world,is,what,i,look,forward
to,as,her,greatest,possibleadvantage
after,a,short,pause,he,resumed,the,conversation,by,saying,does,your
sister,make,no,distinction,in,her,objections,against,a,secondattachment
or,is,it,equally,criminal,in,everybody

dangerous

your,sister,who,thought,and,judged,like,her,but,who,from,an
enforced,change,from,a,series,of,unfortunate,circumstances,here,he,stopped,suddenly
appeared,to,think,that,he,had,said,too,much,and,by,his
countenance,gave,rise,to,conjectures,which,might,not,otherwise,have,entered,elinor
shead
the,lady,would,probably,have,passed,without,suspicion,had,he,not,convinced
miss,dashwood,that,what,concerned,her,ought,not,to,escape,hislips
as,it,was,it,required,but,a,slight,effort,of,fancy,to
connect,his,emotion,with,the,tender,recollection,of,pastregard

but,marianne,in,her,place,would,not,have,done,solittle
the,whole,story,would,have,been,speedily,formed,under,her,active,imagination
and,every,thing,established,in,the,most,melancholy,order,of,disastrouslove
chapter,xii,as,elinor,and,marianne,were,walking,together,the,next,morning
the,latter,communicated,a,piece,of,news,to,her,sister,which,in
spite,of,all,that,she,knew,before,of,marianne,s,imprudence,and
want,of,thought,surprised,her,by,its,extravagant,testimony,ofboth
marianne,told,her,with,the,greatest,delight,that,willoughby,had,given,her
a,horse,one,that,he,had,bred,himself,on,his,estate,in
somersetshire,and,which,was,exactly,calculated,to,carry,awoman
without,considering,that,it,was,not,in,her,mother,s,plan,to
keep,any,horse,that,if,she,were,to,alter,her,resolution,in
favour,of,this,gift,she,must,buy,another,for,the,servant,and
keep,a,servant,to,ride,it,and,after,all,build,a,stable
to,receive,them,she,had,accepted,the,present,without,hesitation,and,told
her,sister,of,it,inraptures

added,and,when,it,arrives,we,will,ride,everyday
you,shall,share,its,use,withme
imagine,to,yourself,my,dear,elinor,the,delight,of,a,gallop,on
some,of,thesedowns
most,unwilling,was,she,to,awaken,from,such,a,dream,of,felicity
to,comprehend,all,the,unhappy,truths,which,attended,the,affair,and,for
some,time,she,refused,to,submit,tothem
as,to,an,additional,servant,the,expense,would,be,a,trifle,mamma
she,was,sure,would,never,object,to,it,and,any,horse,would
do,for,_him_,he,might,always,get,one,at,the,park,as
to,a,stable,the,merest,shed,would,besufficient
elinor,then,ventured,to,doubt,the,propriety,of,her,receiving,such,a
present,from,a,man,so,little,or,at,least,so,lately,known
toher
this,was,toomuch
you,are,mistaken,elinor,said,she,warmly,in,supposing,i,know,very
little,ofwilloughby
i,have,not,known,him,long,indeed,but,i,am,much,better
acquainted,with,him,than,i,am,with,any,other,creature,in,the

she,knew,her,sister,stemper
opposition,on,so,tender,a,subject,would,only,attach,her,the,more
to,her,ownopinion
but,by,an,appeal,to,her,affection,for,her,mother,by,representing
the,inconveniences,which,that,indulgent,mother,must,draw,on,herself,if,as
would,probably,be,the,case,she,consented,to,this,increase,of,establishment
marianne,was,shortly,subdued,and,she,promised,not,to,tempt,her,mother
to,such,imprudent,kindness,by,mentioning,the,offer,and,to,tell,willoughby
when,she,saw,him,next,that,it,must,bedeclined
she,was,faithful,to,her,word,and,when,willoughby,called,at,the
cottage,the,same,day,elinor,heard,her,express,her,disappointment,to,him
in,a,low,voice,on,being,obliged,to,forego,the,acceptance,of
hispresent
the,reasons,for,this,alteration,were,at,the,same,time,related,and
they,were,such,as,to,make,further,entreaty,on,his,sideimpossible
his,concern,however,was,very,apparent,and,after,expressing,it,with,earnestness
he,added,in,the,same,low,voice,but,marianne,the,horse,is
still,yours,though,you,cannot,use,itnow
i,shall,keep,it,only,till,you,can,claimit
when,you,leave,barton,to,form,your,own,establishment,in,a,more

this,was,all,overheard,by,miss,dashwood,and,in,the,whole,of
the,sentence,in,his,manner,of,pronouncing,it,and,in,his,addressing
her,sister,by,her,christian,name,alone,she,instantly,saw,an,intimacy
so,decided,a,meaning,so,direct,as,marked,a,perfect,agreement,between
them
from,that,moment,she,doubted,not,of,their,being,engaged,to,each
other,and,the,belief,of,it,created,no,other,surprise,than,that
she,or,any,of,their,friends,should,be,left,by,tempers,so
frank,to,discover,it,byaccident
margaret,related,something,to,her,the,next,day,which,placed,this,matter
in,a,still,clearerlight
willoughby,had,spent,the,preceding,evening,with,them,and,margaret,by,being
left,some,time,in,the,parlour,with,only,him,and,marianne,had
had,opportunity,for,observations,which,with,a,most,important,face,she,communicated
to,her,eldest,sister,when,they,were,next,bythemselves
ohelinor
she,cried,i,have,such,a,secret,to,tell,you,aboutmarianne
i,am,sure,she,will,be,married,to,mr,willoughby,verysoon
you,have,said,so,replied,elinor,almost,every,day,since,they,first
met,on,high,church,down,and,they,had,not,known,each,other
a,week,i,believe,before,you,were,certain,that,marianne,wore,his
picture,round,her,neck,but,it,turned,out,to,be,only,the
miniature,of,our,greatuncle
but,indeed,this,is,quite,anotherthing
i,am,sure,they,will,be,married,very,soon,for,he,has
got,a,lock,of,herhair

it,may,be,only,the,hair,of,some,great,uncle,of_his_
but,indeed,elinor,it,is,mariannes
i,am,almost,sure,it,is,for,i,saw,him,cut,it
off
last,night,after,tea,when,you,and,mama,went,out,of,the
room,they,were,whispering,and,talking,together,as,fast,as,could,be
and,he,seemed,to,be,begging,something,of,her,and,presently,he
took,up,her,scissors,and,cut,off,a,long,lock,of,her
hair,for,it,was,all,tumbled,down,her,back,and,he,kissed
it,and,folded,it,up,in,a,piece,of,white,paper,and
put,it,into,his,pocketbook
for,such,particulars,stated,on,such,authority,elinor,could,not,withhold,her
credit,nor,was,she,disposed,to,it,for,the,circumstance,was,in
perfect,unison,with,what,she,had,heard,and,seenherself
margaret,s,sagacity,was,not,always,displayed,in,a,way,so,satisfactory
to,hersister
when,mrs,jennings,attacked,her,one,evening,at,the,park,to,give
the,name,of,the,young,man,who,was,elinor,s,particular,favourite
which,had,been,long,a,matter,of,great,curiosity,to,her,margaret
answered,by,looking,at,her,sister,and,saying,i,must,not,tell
may,ielinor
this,of,course,made,every,body,laugh,and,elinor,tried,to,laugh
too
but,the,effort,waspainful
she,was,convinced,that,margaret,had,fixed,on,a,person,whose,name
she,could,not,bear,with,composure,to,become,a,standing,joke,with
mrsjennings
illustration,_he,cut,off,a,long,lock,of,her,hair,_,marianne
felt,for,her,most,sincerely,but,she,did,more,harm,than,good
to,the,cause,by,turning,very,red,and,saying,in,an,angry
manner,to,margaret,remember,that,whatever,your,conjectures,may,be,you,have
no,right,to,repeatthem
i,never,had,any,conjectures,about,it,replied,margaret,it,was,you
who,told,me,of,ityourself
this,increased,the,mirth,of,the,company,and,margaret,was,eagerly,pressed
to,say,somethingmore
oh
pray,miss,margaret,let,us,know,all,about,it,said,mrsjennings
what,is,the,gentleman,sname
i,must,not,tell,maam
but,i,know,very,well,what,it,is,and,i,know,where
he,istoo
yes,yes,we,can,guess,where,he,is,at,his,own,house
at,norland,to,besure
he,is,the,curate,of,the,parish,i,daresay
no,_that_,he,isnot
he,is,of,no,profession,atall
margaret,said,marianne,with,great,warmth,you,know,that,all,this,is
an,invention,of,your,own,and,that,there,is,no,such,person
inexistence
well,then,he,is,lately,dead,marianne,for,i,am,sure,there
was,such,a,man,once,and,his,name,begins,with,an,f
most,grateful,did,elinor,feel,to,lady,middleton,for,observing,at,this
moment,that,it,rained,very,hard,though,she,believed,the,interruption,to
proceed,less,from,any,attention,to,her,than,from,her,ladyship,s
great,dislike,of,all,such,inelegant,subjects,of,raillery,as,delighted,her
husband,andmother
the,idea,however,started,by,her,was,immediately,pursued,by,colonel,brandon
who,was,on,every,occasion,mindful,of,the,feelings,of,others,and
much,was,said,on,the,subject,of,rain,by,both,ofthem
willoughby,opened,the,piano,forte,and,asked,marianne,to,sit,down,to
it,and,thus,amidst,the,various,endeavours,of,different,people,to,quit
the,topic,it,fell,to,theground
but,not,so,easily,did,elinor,recover,from,the,alarm,into,which
it,had,thrownher
a,party,was,formed,this,evening,for,going,on,the,following,day
to,see,a,very,fine,place,about,twelve,miles,from,barton,belonging
to,a,brother,in,law,of,colonel,brandon,without,whose,interest,it
could,not,be,seen,as,the,proprietor,who,was,then,abroad,had
left,strict,orders,on,thathead
the,grounds,were,declared,to,be,highly,beautiful,and,sir,john,who
was,particularly,warm,in,their,praise,might,be,allowed,to,be,a
tolerable,judge,for,he,had,formed,parties,to,visit,them,at,least
twice,every,summer,for,the,last,tenyears
they,contained,a,noble,piece,of,water,a,sail,on,which,was
to,a,form,a,great,part,of,the,morning,s,amusement,cold
provisions,were,to,be,taken,open,carriages,only,to,be,employed,and
every,thing,conducted,in,the,usual,style,of,a,complete,party,of
pleasure
to,some,few,of,the,company,it,appeared,rather,a,bold,undertaking
considering,the,time,of,year,and,that,it,had,rained,every,day
for,the,last,fortnight,and,mrs,dashwood,who,had,already,a,cold
was,persuaded,by,elinor,to,stay,athome
chapter,xiii,their,intended,excursion,to,whitwell,turned,out,very,different,from
what,elinor,hadexpected
she,was,prepared,to,be,wet,through,fatigued,and,frightened,but,the
event,was,still,more,unfortunate,for,they,did,not,go,atall
by,ten,o,clock,the,whole,party,was,assembled,at,the,park
where,they,were,tobreakfast
the,morning,was,rather,favourable,though,it,had,rained,all,night,as
the,clouds,were,then,dispersing,across,the,sky,and,the,sun,frequently
appeared
they,were,all,in,high,spirits,and,good,humour,eager,to,be
happy,and,determined,to,submit,to,the,greatest,inconveniences,and,hardships,rather
than,beotherwise
while,they,were,at,breakfast,the,letters,were,broughtin
among,the,rest,there,was,one,for,colonel,brandon,he,took,it
looked,at,the,direction,changed,colour,and,immediately,left,theroom
what,is,the,matter,withbrandon
said,sirjohn
nobody,couldtell
i,hope,he,has,had,no,bad,news,said,ladymiddleton
it,must,be,something,extraordinary,that,could,make,colonel,brandon,leave,my
breakfast,table,sosuddenly
in,about,five,minutes,hereturned
no,bad,news,colonel,i,hope,said,mrs,jennings,as,soon,as
he,entered,theroom
none,at,all,ma,am,i,thankyou
was,it,fromavignon
i,hope,it,is,not,to,say,that,your,sister,isworse
no,maam
it,came,from,town,and,is,merely,a,letter,ofbusiness
but,how,came,the,hand,to,discompose,you,so,much,if,it
was,only,a,letter,ofbusiness
come,come,this,won,t,do,colonel,so,let,us,hear,the
truth,ofit
my,dear,madam,said,lady,middleton,recollect,what,you,aresaying
perhaps,it,is,to,tell,you,that,your,cousin,fanny,ismarried
said,mrs,jennings,without,attending,to,her,daughter,sreproof
no,indeed,it,isnot
well,then,i,know,who,it,is,fromcolonel
and,i,hope,she,iswell

requires,my,immediate,attendance,intown
intown
cried,mrsjennings
what,can,you,have,to,do,in,town,at,this,time,of
year
my,own,loss,is,great,he,continued,in,being,obliged,to,leave
so,agreeable,a,party,but,i,am,the,more,concerned,as,i
fear,my,presence,is,necessary,to,gain,your,admittance,atwhitwell
what,a,blow,upon,them,all,wasthis
but,if,you,write,a,note,to,the,housekeeper,mr,brandon,said
marianne,eagerly,will,it,not,besufficient
he,shook,hishead
we,must,go,said,sirjohn
it,shall,not,be,put,off,when,we,are,so,nearit
you,cannot,go,to,town,till,tomorrow,brandon,that,isall
i,wish,it,could,be,so,easilysettled
but,it,is,not,in,my,power,to,delay,my,journey,for
oneday
if,you,would,but,let,us,know,what,your,business,is,said
mrs,jennings,we,might,see,whether,it,could,be,put,off,or
not
you,would,not,be,six,hours,later,said,willoughby,if,you,were
to,defer,your,journey,till,ourreturn
i,cannot,afford,to,lose,_one_hour
elinor,then,heard,willoughby,say,in,a,low,voice,to,marianne,there
are,some,people,who,cannot,bear,a,party,ofpleasure
brandon,is,one,ofthem
he,was,afraid,of,catching,cold,i,dare,say,and,invented,this
trick,for,getting,out,ofit
i,would,lay,fifty,guineas,the,letter,was,of,his,ownwriting
i,have,no,doubt,of,it,repliedmarianne
there,is,no,persuading,you,to,change,your,mind,brandon,i,know
of,old,said,sir,john,when,once,you,are,determined,onanything
but,however,i,hope,you,will,think,better,ofit
consider,here,are,the,two,miss,careys,come,over,from,newton,the
three,miss,dashwoods,walked,up,from,the,cottage,and,mr,willoughby,got
up,two,hours,before,his,usual,time,on,purpose,to,go,to
whitwell
colonel,brandon,again,repeated,his,sorrow,at,being,the,cause,of,disappointing
the,party,but,at,the,same,time,declared,it,to,beunavoidable
well,then,when,will,you,come,backagain
i,hope,we,shall,see,you,at,barton,added,her,ladyship,as
soon,as,you,can,conveniently,leave,town,and,we,must,put,off
the,party,to,whitwell,till,youreturn
you,are,veryobliging
but,it,is,so,uncertain,when,i,may,have,it,in,my
power,to,return,that,i,dare,not,engage,for,it,atall
oh
he,must,and,shall,come,back,cried,sirjohn
if,he,is,not,here,by,the,end,of,the,week,i
shall,go,afterhim
ay,so,do,sir,john,cried,mrs,jennings,and,then,perhaps,you
may,find,out,what,his,businessis
i,do,not,want,to,pry,into,other,men,sconcerns
i,suppose,it,is,something,he,is,ashamedof
colonel,brandon,s,horses,wereannounced
you,do,not,go,to,town,on,horseback,doyou
added,sirjohn
no
only,tohoniton
i,shall,then,gopost
well,as,you,are,resolved,to,go,i,wish,you,a,good
journey
but,you,had,better,change,yourmind
i,assure,you,it,is,not,in,mypower
he,then,took,leave,of,the,wholeparty
is,there,no,chance,of,my,seeing,you,and,your,sisters,in
town,this,winter,missdashwood
i,am,afraid,none,atall
then,i,must,bid,you,farewell,for,a,longer,time,than,i
should,wish,todo
to,marianne,he,merely,bowed,and,saidnothing
come,colonel,said,mrs,jennings,before,you,go,do,let,us,know
what,you,are,goingabout
he,wished,her,a,good,morning,and,attended,by,sir,john,left
theroom
the,complaints,and,lamentations,which,politeness,had,hitherto,restrained,now,burst,forth
universally,and,they,all,agreed,again,and,again,how,provoking,it,was
to,be,sodisappointed
i,can,guess,what,his,business,is,however,said,mrs,jenningsexultingly
can,you,maam
said,almost,everybody
yes,it,is,about,miss,williams,i,amsure
and,who,is,misswilliams
askedmarianne
what
do,not,you,know,who,miss,williamsis
i,am,sure,you,must,have,heard,of,herbefore
she,is,a,relation,of,the,colonel,s,my,dear,a,very
nearrelation
we,will,not,say,how,near,for,fear,of,shocking,the,young
ladies
then,lowering,her,voice,a,little,she,said,to,elinor,she,is
his,naturaldaughter
indeed
oh,yes,and,as,like,him,as,she,canstare
i,dare,say,the,colonel,will,leave,her,all,hisfortune
when,sir,john,returned,he,joined,most,heartily,in,the,general,regret
on,so,unfortunate,an,event,concluding,however,by,observing,that,as,they
were,all,got,together,they,must,do,something,by,way,of,being
happy,and,after,some,consultation,it,was,agreed,that,although,happiness,could
only,be,enjoyed,at,whitwell,they,might,procure,a,tolerable,composure,of
mind,by,driving,about,thecountry
the,carriages,were,then,ordered,willoughby,s,was,first,and,marianne,never
looked,happier,than,when,she,got,intoit
he,drove,through,the,park,very,fast,and,they,were,soon,out
of,sight,and,nothing,more,of,them,was,seen,till,their,return
which,did,not,happen,till,after,the,return,of,all,therest
they,both,seemed,delighted,with,their,drive,but,said,only,in,general
terms,that,they,had,kept,in,the,lanes,while,the,others,went
on,thedowns
it,was,settled,that,there,should,be,a,dance,in,the,evening
and,that,every,body,should,be,extremely,merry,all,daylong
some,more,of,the,careys,came,to,dinner,and,they,had,the
pleasure,of,sitting,down,nearly,twenty,to,table,which,sir,john,observed
with,greatcontentment
willoughby,took,his,usual,place,between,the,two,elder,missdashwoods
mrs,jennings,sat,on,elinor,s,right,hand,and,they,had,not
been,long,seated,before,she,leant,behind,her,and,willoughby,and,said
to,marianne,loud,enough,for,them,both,to,hear,i,have,found
you,out,in,spite,of,all,yourtricks
i,know,where,you,spent,themorning
marianne,coloured,and,replied,very,hastily,wherepray
did,not,you,know,said,willoughby,that,we,had,been,out,in
mycurricle
yes,yes,mr,impudence,i,know,that,very,well,and,i,was
determined,to,find,out,_where_,you,had,beento
i,hope,you,like,your,house,missmarianne
it,is,a,very,large,one,i,know,and,when,i,come
to,see,you,i,hope,you,will,have,new,furnished,it,for
it,wanted,it,very,much,when,i,was,there,six,yearsago
marianne,turned,away,in,greatconfusion
mrs,jennings,laughed,heartily,and,elinor,found,that,in,her,resolution,to
know,where,they,had,been,she,had,actually,made,her,own,woman
enquire,of,mr,willoughby,s,groom,and,that,she,had,by,that
method,been,informed,that,they,had,gone,to,allenham,and,spent,a
considerable,time,there,in,walking,about,the,garden,and,going,all,over
thehouse
elinor,could,hardly,believe,this,to,be,true,as,it,seemed,very
unlikely,that,willoughby,should,propose,or,marianne,consent,to,enter,the,house
while,mrs,smith,was,in,it,with,whom,marianne,had,not,the
smallestacquaintance
as,soon,as,they,left,the,dining,room,elinor,enquired,of,her
about,it,and,great,was,her,surprise,when,she,found,that,every
circumstance,related,by,mrs,jennings,was,perfectlytrue
marianne,was,quite,angry,with,her,for,doubtingit
why,should,you,imagine,elinor,that,we,did,not,go,there,or
that,we,did,not,see,thehouse
is,not,it,what,you,have,often,wished,to,doyourself
yes,marianne,but,i,would,not,go,while,mrs,smith,was,there
and,with,no,other,companion,thanmr
willoughby
illustration,_i,have,found,you,out,in,spite,of,all,your,tricks
_,mr,willoughby,however,is,the,only,person,who,can,have,a
right,to,show,that,house,and,as,he,went,in,an,open
carriage,it,was,impossible,to,have,any,othercompanion
i,never,spent,a,pleasanter,morning,in,mylife
i,am,afraid,replied,elinor,that,the,pleasantness,of,an,employment,does
not,always,evince,itspropriety
on,the,contrary,nothing,can,be,a,stronger,proof,of,it,elinor
for,if,there,had,been,any,real,impropriety,in,what,i,did
i,should,have,been,sensible,of,it,at,the,time,for,we
always,know,when,we,are,acting,wrong,and,with,such,a,conviction
i,could,have,had,nopleasure
but,my,dear,marianne,as,it,has,already,exposed,you,to,some
very,impertinent,remarks,do,you,not,now,begin,to,doubt,the,discretion
of,your,ownconduct
if,the,impertinent,remarks,of,mrs,jennings,are,to,be,the,proof
of,impropriety,in,conduct,we,are,all,offending,every,moment,of,our
lives
i,value,not,her,censure,any,more,than,i,should,do,her
commendation
i,am,not,sensible,of,having,done,anything,wrong,in,walking,over
mrs,smith,s,grounds,or,in,seeing,herhouse
they,will,one,day,be,mr,willoughby,s,and,if,they,were
one,day,to,be,your,own,marianne,you,would,not,be,justified
in,what,you,havedone
she,blushed,at,this,hint,but,it,was,even,visibly,gratifying,to
her,and,after,a,ten,minutes,interval,of,earnest,thought,she,came
to,her,sister,again,and,said,with,great,good,humour,perhaps,elinor
it,_was_,rather,ill,judged,in,me,to,go,to,allenham,but
mr,willoughby,wanted,particularly,to,show,me,the,place,and,it,is
a,charming,house,i,assureyou
there,is,one,remarkably,pretty,sitting,room,up,stairs,of,a,nice
comfortable,size,for,constant,use,and,with,modern,furniture,it,would,be
delightful
it,is,a,corner,room,and,has,windows,on,twosides
on,one,side,you,look,across,the,bowling,green,behind,the,house
to,a,beautiful,hanging,wood,and,on,the,other,you,have,a
view,of,the,church,and,village,and,beyond,them,of,those,fine
bold,hills,that,we,have,so,oftenadmired
i,did,not,see,it,to,advantage,for,nothing,could,be,more
forlorn,than,the,furniture,but,if,it,were,newly,fitted,up,a
couple,of,hundred,pounds,willoughby,says,would,make,it,one,of,the
pleasantest,summer,rooms,inengland
could,elinor,have,listened,to,her,without,interruption,from,the,others,she
would,have,described,every,room,in,the,house,with,equaldelight
chapter,xiv,the,sudden,termination,of,colonel,brandon,s,visit,at,the
park,with,his,steadiness,in,concealing,its,cause,filled,the,mind,and
raised,the,wonder,of,mrs,jennings,for,two,or,three,days,she
was,a,great,wonderer,as,every,one,must,be,who,takes,a
very,lively,interest,in,all,the,comings,and,goings,of,all,their
acquaintance
she,wondered,with,little,intermission,what,could,be,the,reason,of,it
was,sure,there,must,be,some,bad,news,and,thought,over,every
kind,of,distress,that,could,have,befallen,him,with,a,fixed,determination
that,he,should,not,escape,themall
something,very,melancholy,must,be,the,matter,i,am,sure,saidshe
i,could,see,it,in,hisface
poorman
i,am,afraid,his,circumstances,may,bebad
the,estate,at,delaford,was,never,reckoned,more,than,two,thousand,a
year,and,his,brother,left,everything,sadlyinvolved
i,do,think,he,must,have,been,sent,for,about,money,matters
for,what,else,can,itbe
i,wonder,whether,it,isso
i,would,give,anything,to,know,the,truth,ofit
perhaps,it,is,about,miss,williams,and,by,the,bye,i,dare
say,it,is,because,he,looked,so,conscious,when,i,mentionedher
may,be,she,is,ill,in,town,nothing,in,the,world,more
likely,for,i,have,a,notion,she,is,always,rathersickly
i,would,lay,any,wager,it,is,about,misswilliams
it,is,not,so,very,likely,he,should,be,distressed,in,his
circumstances,_now_,for,he,is,a,very,prudent,man,and,to,be
sure,must,have,cleared,the,estate,by,thistime
i,wonder,what,it,canbe
may,be,his,sister,is,worse,at,avignon,and,has,sent,for
himover
his,setting,off,in,such,a,hurry,seems,very,likeit
well,i,wish,him,out,of,all,his,trouble,with,all,my
heart,and,a,good,wife,into,thebargain
so,wondered,so,talked,mrsjennings
her,opinion,varying,with,every,fresh,conjecture,and,all,seeming,equally,probable
as,theyarose
elinor,though,she,felt,really,interested,in,the,welfare,of,colonel,brandon
could,not,bestow,all,the,wonder,on,his,going,so,suddenly,away
which,mrs,jennings,was,desirous,of,her,feeling,for,besides,that,the
circumstance,did,not,in,her,opinion,justify,such,lasting,amazement,or,variety
of,speculation,her,wonder,was,otherwise,disposedof
it,was,engrossed,by,the,extraordinary,silence,of,her,sister,and,willoughby
on,the,subject,which,they,must,know,to,be,peculiarly,interesting,to
themall
as,this,silence,continued,every,day,made,it,appear,more,strange,and
more,incompatible,with,the,disposition,ofboth
why,they,should,not,openly,acknowledge,to,her,mother,and,herself,what
their,constant,behaviour,to,each,other,declared,to,have,taken,place,elinor
could,notimagine
she,could,easily,conceive,that,marriage,might,not,be,immediately,in,their
power,for,though,willoughby,was,independent,there,was,no,reason,to,believe
himrich
his,estate,had,been,rated,by,sir,john,at,about,six,or
seven,hundred,a,year,but,he,lived,at,an,expense,to,which
that,income,could,hardly,be,equal,and,he,had,himself,often,complained
of,hispoverty
but,for,this,strange,kind,of,secrecy,maintained,by,them,relative,to
their,engagement,which,in,fact,concealed,nothing,at,all,she,could,not
account,and,it,was,so,wholly,contradictory,to,their,general,opinions,and
practice,that,a,doubt,sometimes,entered,her,mind,of,their,being,really
engaged,and,this,doubt,was,enough,to,prevent,her,making,any,inquiry
ofmarianne
nothing,could,be,more,expressive,of,attachment,to,them,all,than,willoughby
sbehaviour
to,marianne,it,had,all,the,distinguishing,tenderness,which,a,lover,s
heart,could,give,and,to,the,rest,of,the,family,it,was
the,affectionate,attention,of,a,son,and,abrother
the,cottage,seemed,to,be,considered,and,loved,by,him,as,his
home,many,more,of,his,hours,were,spent,there,than,at,allenham
and,if,no,general,engagement,collected,them,at,the,park,the,exercise
which,called,him,out,in,the,morning,was,almost,certain,of,ending
there,where,the,rest,of,the,day,was,spent,by,himself,at
the,side,of,marianne,and,by,his,favourite,pointer,at,herfeet
one,evening,in,particular,about,a,week,after,colonel,brandon,left,the
country,his,heart,seemed,more,than,usually,open,to,every,feeling,of
attachment,to,the,objects,around,him,and,on,mrs,dashwood,s,happening
to,mention,her,design,of,improving,the,cottage,in,the,spring,he
warmly,opposed,every,alteration,of,a,place,which,affection,had,established,as
perfect,withhim
what
he,exclaimed,improve,this,dearcottage
no
_that_,i,will,never,consentto
not,a,stone,must,be,added,to,its,walls,not,an,inch
to,its,size,if,my,feelings,areregarded
do,not,be,alarmed,said,miss,dashwood,nothing,of,the,kind,will
be,done,for,my,mother,will,never,have,money,enough,to,attempt
it
i,am,heartily,glad,of,it,hecried
may,she,always,be,poor,if,she,can,employ,her,riches,no
better
thank,youwilloughby
but,you,may,be,assured,that,i,would,not,sacrifice,one,sentiment
of,local,attachment,of,yours,or,of,any,one,whom,i,loved
for,all,the,improvements,in,theworld
depend,upon,it,that,whatever,unemployed,sum,may,remain,when,i,make
up,my,accounts,in,the,spring,i,would,even,rather,lay,it
uselessly,by,than,dispose,of,it,in,a,manner,so,painful,to
you
but,are,you,really,so,attached,to,this,place,as,to,see
no,defect,init
i,am,saidhe
to,me,it,isfaultless
nay,more,i,consider,it,as,the,only,form,of,building,in
which,happiness,is,attainable,and,were,i,rich,enough,i,would,instantly
pull,combe,down,and,build,it,up,again,in,the,exact,plan
of,thiscottage
with,dark,narrow,stairs,and,a,kitchen,that,smokes,i,suppose,said
elinor
yes,cried,he,in,the,same,eager,tone,with,all,and,every
thing,belonging,to,it,in,no,one,convenience,or,inconvenience,about,it
should,the,least,variation,beperceptible
then,and,then,only,under,such,a,roof,i,might,perhaps,be
as,happy,at,combe,as,i,have,been,atbarton
i,flatter,myself,replied,elinor,that,even,under,the,disadvantage,of,better
rooms,and,a,broader,staircase,you,will,hereafter,find,your,own,house
as,faultless,as,you,now,dothis
there,certainly,are,circumstances,said,willoughby,which,might,greatly,endear,it,to
me,but,this,place,will,always,have,one,claim,of,my,affection
which,no,other,can,possiblyshare
mrs,dashwood,looked,with,pleasure,at,marianne,whose,fine,eyes,were,fixed
so,expressively,on,willoughby,as,plainly,denoted,how,well,she,understoodhim
how,often,did,i,wish,added,he,when,i,was,at,allenham
this,time,twelvemonth,that,barton,cottage,wereinhabited
i,never,passed,within,view,of,it,without,admiring,its,situation,and
grieving,that,no,one,should,live,init
how,little,did,i,then,think,that,the,very,first,news,i
should,hear,from,mrs,smith,when,i,next,came,into,the,country
would,be,that,barton,cottage,was,taken,and,i,felt,an,immediate
satisfaction,and,interest,in,the,event,which,nothing,but,a,kind,of
prescience,of,what,happiness,i,should,experience,from,it,can,accountfor
must,it,not,have,been,somarianne
speaking,to,her,in,a,loweredvoice
then,continuing,his,former,tone,he,said,and,yet,this,house,you
would,spoil,mrsdashwood
you,would,rob,it,of,its,simplicity,by,imaginaryimprovement
and,this,dear,parlour,in,which,our,acquaintance,first,began,and,in
which,so,many,happy,hours,have,been,since,spent,by,us,together
you,would,degrade,to,the,condition,of,a,common,entrance,and,every
body,would,be,eager,to,pass,through,the,room,which,has,hitherto
contained,within,itself,more,real,accommodation,and,comfort,than,any,other,apartment
of,the,handsomest,dimensions,in,the,world,could,possiblyafford
mrs,dashwood,again,assured,him,that,no,alteration,of,the,kind,should
beattempted
you,are,a,good,woman,he,warmlyreplied
your,promise,makes,meeasy
extend,it,a,little,farther,and,it,will,make,mehappy
tell,me,that,not,only,your,house,will,remain,the,same,but
that,i,shall,ever,find,you,and,yours,as,unchanged,as,your
dwelling,and,that,you,will,always,consider,me,with,the,kindness,which
has,made,everything,belonging,to,you,so,dear,tome
the,promise,was,readily,given,and,willoughby,s,behaviour,during,the,whole
of,the,evening,declared,at,once,his,affection,andhappiness
shall,we,see,you,tomorrow,todinner
said,mrs,dashwood,when,he,was,leavingthem
i,do,not,ask,you,to,come,in,the,morning,for,we
must,walk,to,the,park,to,call,on,ladymiddleton
he,engaged,to,be,with,them,by,four,oclock
chapter,xv,mrs,dashwood,s,visit,to,lady,middleton,took,place,the
next,day,and,two,of,her,daughters,went,with,her,but,marianne
excused,herself,from,being,of,the,party,under,some,trifling,pretext,of
employment,and,her,mother,who,concluded,that,a,promise,had,been,made
by,willoughby,the,night,before,of,calling,on,her,while,they,were
absent,was,perfectly,satisfied,with,her,remaining,athome
on,their,return,from,the,park,they,found,willoughby,s,curricle,and
servant,in,waiting,at,the,cottage,and,mrs,dashwood,was,convinced,that
her,conjecture,had,beenjust
so,far,it,was,all,as,she,had,foreseen,but,on,entering
the,house,she,beheld,what,no,foresight,had,taught,her,toexpect
they,were,no,sooner,in,the,passage,than,marianne,came,hastily,out
of,the,parlour,apparently,in,violent,affliction,with,her,handkerchief,at,her
eyes,and,without,noticing,them,ran,upstairs
surprised,and,alarmed,they,proceeded,directly,into,the,room,she,had,just
quitted,where,they,found,only,willoughby,who,was,leaning,against,the,mantelpiece
with,his,back,towardsthem
he,turned,round,on,their,coming,in,and,his,countenance,showed,that
he,strongly,partook,of,the,emotion,which,overpoweredmarianne
is,anything,the,matter,withher
cried,mrs,dashwood,as,she,entered,is,sheill
i,hope,not,he,replied,trying,to,look,cheerful,and,with,a
forced,smile,presently,added,it,is,i,who,may,rather,expect,to
be,ill,for,i,am,now,suffering,under,a,very,heavydisappointment
disappointment
yes,for,i,am,unable,to,keep,my,engagement,withyou
mrs,smith,has,this,morning,exercised,the,privilege,of,riches,upon,a
poor,dependent,cousin,by,sending,me,on,business,tolondon
i,have,just,received,my,dispatches,and,taken,my,farewell,of,allenham
and,by,way,of,exhilaration,i,am,now,come,to,take,my
farewell,ofyou
to,london,and,are,you,going,thismorning
almost,thismoment
illustration,_apparently,in,violent,affliction,_,this,is,veryunfortunate
but,mrs,smith,must,be,obliged,and,her,business,will,not,detain
you,from,us,long,ihope
he,coloured,as,he,replied,you,are,very,kind,but,i,have
no,idea,of,returning,into,devonshireimmediately
my,visits,to,mrs,smith,are,never,repeated,within,thetwelvemonth
and,is,mrs,smith,your,onlyfriend
is,allenham,the,only,house,in,the,neighbourhood,to,which,you,will
bewelcome
for,shame,willoughby,can,you,wait,for,an,invitationhere
his,colour,increased,and,with,his,eyes,fixed,on,the,ground,he
only,replied,you,are,toogood
mrs,dashwood,looked,at,elinor,withsurprise
elinor,felt,equalamazement
for,a,few,moments,every,one,wassilent
mrs,dashwood,firstspoke
i,have,only,to,add,my,dear,willoughby,that,at,barton,cottage
you,will,always,be,welcome,for,i,will,not,press,you,to
return,here,immediately,because,you,only,can,judge,how,far,_that_,might
be,pleasing,to,mrs,smith,and,on,this,head,i,shall,be
no,more,disposed,to,question,your,judgment,than,to,doubt,yourinclination
my,engagements,at,present,replied,willoughby,confusedly,are,of,such,a,nature
that,i,dare,not,flatter,myself,hestopped
mrs,dashwood,was,too,much,astonished,to,speak,and,another,pausesucceeded
this,was,broken,by,willoughby,who,said,with,a,faint,smile,it
is,folly,to,linger,in,thismanner
i,will,not,torment,myself,any,longer,by,remaining,among,friends,whose
society,it,is,impossible,for,me,now,toenjoy
he,then,hastily,took,leave,of,them,all,and,left,theroom
they,saw,him,step,into,his,carriage,and,in,a,minute,it
was,out,ofsight
mrs,dashwood,felt,too,much,for,speech,and,instantly,quitted,the,parlour
to,give,way,in,solitude,to,the,concern,and,alarm,which,this
sudden,departureoccasioned
elinor,s,uneasiness,was,at,least,equal,to,her,mothers
she,thought,of,what,had,just,passed,with,anxiety,anddistrust
willoughby,s,behaviour,in,taking,leave,of,them,his,embarrassment,and,affectation
of,cheerfulness,and,above,all,his,unwillingness,to,accept,her,mother,s
invitation,a,backwardness,so,unlike,a,lover,so,unlike,himself,greatly,disturbed
her
one,moment,she,feared,that,no,serious,design,had,ever,been,formed
on,his,side,and,the,next,that,some,unfortunate,quarrel,had,taken
place,between,him,and,hersister
the,distress,in,which,marianne,had,quitted,the,room,was,such,as
a,serious,quarrel,could,most,reasonably,account,for,though,when,she,considered
what,marianne,s,love,for,him,was,a,quarrel,seemed,almostimpossible
but,whatever,might,be,the,particulars,of,their,separation,her,sister,s
affliction,was,indubitable,and,she,thought,with,the,tenderest,compassion,of,that
violent,sorrow,which,marianne,was,in,all,probability,not,merely,giving,way
to,as,a,relief,but,feeding,and,encouraging,as,aduty
in,about,half,an,hour,her,mother,returned,and,though,her,eyes
were,red,her,countenance,was,notuncheerful
our,dear,willoughby,is,now,some,miles,from,barton,elinor,said,she
as,she,sat,down,to,work,and,with,how,heavy,a,heart
does,hetravel
it,is,all,verystrange
so,suddenly,to,begone
it,seems,but,the,work,of,amoment
and,last,night,he,was,with,us,so,happy,so,cheerful,so
affectionate
and,now,after,only,ten,minutes,notice,gone,too,without,intending,to
return
something,more,than,what,he,owned,to,us,must,havehappened
he,did,not,speak,he,did,not,behave,likehimself
_you_,must,have,seen,the,difference,as,well,asi
what,can,itbe
can,they,havequarrelled
why,else,should,he,have,shown,such,unwillingness,to,accept,your,invitation
here
it,was,not,inclination,that,he,wanted,elinor,i,could,plainly,see
_that,_,he,had,not,the,power,of,acceptingit
i,have,thought,it,all,over,i,assure,you,and,i,can
perfectly,account,for,every,thing,that,at,first,seemed,strange,to,me
as,well,as,toyou
can,youindeed
yes
i,have,explained,it,to,myself,in,the,most,satisfactory,way,but
you,elinor,who,love,to,doubt,where,you,can,it,will,not
satisfy,_you_,i,know,but,you,shall,not,talk,_me_,out,of
my,trust,init
i,am,persuaded,that,mrs,smith,suspects,his,regard,for,marianne,disapproves
of,it,perhaps,because,she,has,other,views,for,him,and,on
that,account,is,eager,to,get,him,away,and,that,the,business
which,she,sends,him,off,to,transact,is,invented,as,an,excuse
to,dismisshim
this,is,what,i,believe,to,havehappened
he,is,moreover,aware,that,she,_does_,disapprove,the,connection,he,dares
not,therefore,at,present,confess,to,her,his,engagement,with,marianne,and
he,feels,himself,obliged,from,his,dependent,situation,to,give,into,her
schemes,and,absent,himself,from,devonshire,for,awhile
you,will,tell,me,i,know,that,this,may,or,may,_not_
have,happened,but,i,will,listen,to,no,cavil,unless,you,can
point,out,any,other,method,of,understanding,the,affair,as,satisfactory,at
this
and,now,elinor,what,have,you,tosay
nothing,for,you,have,anticipated,myanswer
then,you,would,have,told,me,that,it,might,or,might,not
havehappened
oh,elinor,how,incomprehensible,are,yourfeelings
you,had,rather,take,evil,upon,credit,thangood
you,had,rather,look,out,for,misery,for,marianne,and,guilt,for
poor,willoughby,than,an,apology,for,thelatter
you,are,resolved,to,think,him,blamable,because,he,took,leave,of
us,with,less,affection,than,his,usual,behaviour,hasshown
and,is,no,allowance,to,be,made,for,inadvertence,or,for,spirits
depressed,by,recentdisappointment
are,no,probabilities,to,be,accepted,merely,because,they,are,notcertainties
is,nothing,due,to,the,man,whom,we,have,all,such,reason
to,love,and,no,reason,in,the,world,to,think,ill,of
to,the,possibility,of,motives,unanswerable,in,themselves,though,unavoidably,secret,for
awhile
and,after,all,what,is,it,you,suspect,himof
i,can,hardly,tellmyself
but,suspicion,of,something,unpleasant,is,the,inevitable,consequence,of,such,an
alteration,as,we,just,witnessed,inhim
there,is,great,truth,however,in,what,you,have,now,urged,of
the,allowances,which,ought,to,be,made,for,him,and,it,is
my,wish,to,be,candid,in,my,judgment,of,everybody
willoughby,may,undoubtedly,have,very,sufficient,reasons,for,his,conduct,and,i
will,hope,that,hehas
but,it,would,have,been,more,like,willoughby,to,acknowledge,them,at
once
secrecy,may,be,advisable,but,still,i,cannot,help,wondering,at,its
being,practiced,byhim
do,not,blame,him,however,for,departing,from,his,character,where,the
deviation,isnecessary
but,you,really,do,admit,the,justice,of,what,i,have,said
in,his,defence,i,am,happy,and,he,isacquitted
notentirely
it,may,be,proper,to,conceal,their,engagement,if,they,_are_,engaged
from,mrs,smith,and,if,that,is,the,case,it,must,be
highly,expedient,for,willoughby,to,be,but,little,in,devonshire,atpresent
but,this,is,no,excuse,for,their,concealing,it,fromus
concealing,it,fromus
my,dear,child,do,you,accuse,willoughby,and,marianne,ofconcealment
this,is,strange,indeed,when,your,eyes,have,been,reproaching,them,every
day,forincautiousness
i,want,no,proof,of,their,affection,said,elinor,but,of,their
engagement,ido
i,am,perfectly,satisfied,ofboth
yet,not,a,syllable,has,been,said,to,you,on,the,subject
by,either,ofthem
i,have,not,wanted,syllables,where,actions,have,spoken,soplainly
has,not,his,behaviour,to,marianne,and,to,all,of,us,for
at,least,the,last,fortnight,declared,that,he,loved,and,considered,her
as,his,future,wife,and,that,he,felt,for,us,the,attachment
of,the,nearestrelation
have,we,not,perfectly,understood,eachother
has,not,my,consent,been,daily,asked,by,his,looks,his,manner
his,attentive,and,affectionaterespect
my,elinor,is,it,possible,to,doubt,theirengagement
how,could,such,a,thought,occur,toyou
how,is,it,to,be,supposed,that,willoughby,persuaded,as,he,must
be,of,your,sister,s,love,should,leave,her,and,leave,her
perhaps,for,months,without,telling,her,of,his,affection,that,they,should
part,without,a,mutual,exchange,ofconfidence
i,confess,replied,elinor,that,every,circumstance,except,_one_,is,in,favour
of,their,engagement,but,that,_one_,is,the,total,silence,of,both
on,the,subject,and,with,me,it,almost,outweighs,everyother
how,strange,thisis
you,must,think,wretchedly,indeed,of,willoughby,if,after,all,that,has
openly,passed,between,them,you,can,doubt,the,nature,of,the,terms
on,which,they,aretogether
has,he,been,acting,a,part,in,his,behaviour,to,your,sister
all,thistime
do,you,suppose,him,really,indifferent,toher
no,i,cannot,thinkthat
he,must,and,does,love,her,i,amsure
but,with,a,strange,kind,of,tenderness,if,he,can,leave,her
with,such,indifference,such,carelessness,of,the,future,as,you,attribute,to
him
you,must,remember,my,dear,mother,that,i,have,never,considered,this
matter,ascertain
i,have,had,my,doubts,i,confess,but,they,are,fainter,than
they,were,and,they,may,soon,be,entirely,doneaway
if,we,find,they,correspond,every,fear,of,mine,will,beremoved
a,mighty,concessionindeed
if,you,were,to,see,them,at,the,altar,you,would,suppose
they,were,going,to,bemarried
ungraciousgirl
but,i,require,no,suchproof
nothing,in,my,opinion,has,ever,passed,to,justify,doubt,no,secrecy
has,been,attempted,all,has,been,uniformly,open,andunreserved
you,cannot,doubt,your,sister,swishes
it,must,be,willoughby,therefore,whom,yoususpect
butwhy
is,he,not,a,man,of,honour,andfeeling
has,there,been,any,inconsistency,on,his,side,to,createalarm
can,he,bedeceitful
i,hope,not,i,believe,not,criedelinor
i,love,willoughby,sincerely,love,him,and,suspicion,of,his,integrity,cannot
be,more,painful,to,yourself,than,tome
it,has,been,involuntary,and,i,will,not,encourageit
i,was,startled,i,confess,by,the,alteration,in,his,manners,this
morning,he,did,not,speak,like,himself,and,did,not,return,your
kindness,with,anycordiality
but,all,this,may,be,explained,by,such,a,situation,of,his
affairs,as,you,havesupposed
he,had,just,parted,from,my,sister,had,seen,her,leave,him
in,the,greatest,affliction,and,if,he,felt,obliged,from,a,fear
of,offending,mrs,smith,to,resist,the,temptation,of,returning,here,soon
and,yet,aware,that,by,declining,your,invitation,by,saying,that,he
was,going,away,for,some,time,he,should,seem,to,act,an
ungenerous,a,suspicious,part,by,our,family,he,might,well,be,embarrassed
anddisturbed
in,such,a,case,a,plain,and,open,avowal,of,his,difficulties
would,have,been,more,to,his,honour,i,think,as,well,as
more,consistent,with,his,general,character,but,i,will,not,raise,objections
against,any,one,s,conduct,on,so,illiberal,a,foundation,as,a
difference,in,judgment,from,myself,or,a,deviation,from,what,i,may
think,right,andconsistent
you,speak,veryproperly
willoughby,certainly,does,not,deserve,to,besuspected
though,_we_,have,not,known,him,long,he,is,no,stranger,in
this,part,of,the,world,and,who,has,ever,spoken,to,his
disadvantage
had,he,been,in,a,situation,to,act,independently,and,marry,immediately
it,might,have,been,odd,that,he,should,leave,us,without,acknowledging
everything,to,me,at,once,but,this,is,not,thecase
it,is,an,engagement,in,some,respects,not,prosperously,begun,for,their
marriage,must,be,at,a,very,uncertain,distance,and,even,secrecy,as
far,as,it,can,be,observed,may,now,be,veryadvisable
they,were,interrupted,by,the,entrance,of,margaret,and,elinor,was,then
at,liberty,to,think,over,the,representations,of,her,mother,to,acknowledge
the,probability,of,many,and,hope,for,the,justice,ofall
they,saw,nothing,of,marianne,till,dinner,time,when,she,entered,the
room,and,took,her,place,at,the,table,without,saying,aword
her,eyes,were,red,and,swollen,and,it,seemed,as,if,her
tears,were,even,then,restrained,withdifficulty
she,avoided,the,looks,of,them,all,could,neither,eat,nor,speak
and,after,some,time,on,her,mother,s,silently,pressing,her,hand
with,tender,compassion,her,small,degree,of,fortitude,was,quite,overcome,she
burst,into,tears,and,left,theroom
this,violent,oppression,of,spirits,continued,the,wholeevening
she,was,without,any,power,because,she,was,without,any,desire,of
command,overherself
the,slightest,mention,of,anything,relative,to,willoughby,overpowered,her,in,an
instant,and,though,her,family,were,most,anxiously,attentive,to,her,comfort
it,was,impossible,for,them,if,they,spoke,at,all,to,keep
clear,of,every,subject,which,her,feelings,connected,withhim
chapter,xvi,marianne,would,have,thought,herself,very,inexcusable,had,she,been
able,to,sleep,at,all,the,first,night,after,parting,fromwilloughby
she,would,have,been,ashamed,to,look,her,family,in,the,face
the,next,morning,had,she,not,risen,from,her,bed,in,more
need,of,repose,than,when,she,lay,down,init
but,the,feelings,which,made,such,composure,a,disgrace,left,her,in
no,danger,of,incurringit
she,was,awake,the,whole,night,and,she,wept,the,greatest,part
ofit
she,got,up,with,a,headache,was,unable,to,talk,and,unwilling
to,take,any,nourishment,giving,pain,every,moment,to,her,mother,and
sisters,and,forbidding,all,attempt,at,consolation,fromeither
her,sensibility,was,potentenough
when,breakfast,was,over,she,walked,out,by,herself,and,wandered,about
the,village,of,allenham,indulging,the,recollection,of,past,enjoyment,and,crying
over,the,present,reverse,for,the,chief,of,themorning
the,evening,passed,off,in,the,equal,indulgence,offeeling
she,played,over,every,favourite,song,that,she,had,been,used,to
play,to,willoughby,every,air,in,which,their,voices,had,been,oftenest
joined,and,sat,at,the,instrument,gazing,on,every,line,of,music
that,he,had,written,out,for,her,till,her,heart,was,so
heavy,that,no,farther,sadness,could,be,gained,and,this,nourishment,of
grief,was,every,dayapplied
she,spent,whole,hours,at,the,pianoforte,alternately,singing,and,crying,her
voice,often,totally,suspended,by,hertears
in,books,too,as,well,as,in,music,she,courted,the,misery
which,a,contrast,between,the,past,and,present,was,certain,ofgiving
she,read,nothing,but,what,they,had,been,used,to,readtogether
such,violence,of,affliction,indeed,could,not,be,supported,for,ever,it
sunk,within,a,few,days,into,a,calmer,melancholy,but,these,employments
to,which,she,daily,recurred,her,solitary,walks,and,silent,meditations,still
produced,occasional,effusions,of,sorrow,as,lively,asever
no,letter,from,willoughby,came,and,none,seemed,expected,bymarianne
her,mother,was,surprised,and,elinor,again,becameuneasy
but,mrs,dashwood,could,find,explanations,whenever,she,wanted,them,which,at
least,satisfiedherself
remember,elinor,said,she,how,very,often,sir,john,fetches,our,letters
himself,from,the,post,and,carries,them,toit
we,have,already,agreed,that,secrecy,may,be,necessary,and,we,must
acknowledge,that,it,could,not,be,maintained,if,their,correspondence,were,to
pass,through,sir,john,shands
elinor,could,not,deny,the,truth,of,this,and,she,tried,to
find,in,it,a,motive,sufficient,for,theirsilence
but,there,was,one,method,so,direct,so,simple,and,in,her
opinion,so,eligible,of,knowing,the,real,state,of,the,affair,and
of,instantly,removing,all,mystery,that,she,could,not,help,suggesting,it
to,hermother
why,do,you,not,ask,marianne,at,once,said,she,whether,she
is,or,she,is,not,engaged,towilloughby
from,you,her,mother,and,so,kind,so,indulgent,a,mother,the
question,could,not,giveoffence
it,would,be,the,natural,result,of,your,affection,forher
she,used,to,be,all,unreserve,and,to,you,moreespecially
i,would,not,ask,such,a,question,for,theworld
supposing,it,possible,that,they,are,not,engaged,what,distress,would,not
such,an,enquiryinflict
at,any,rate,it,would,be,mostungenerous
i,should,never,deserve,her,confidence,again,after,forcing,from,her,a
confession,of,what,is,meant,at,present,to,be,unacknowledged,to,any
one
i,know,marianne,s,heart,i,know,that,she,dearly,loves,me
and,that,i,shall,not,be,the,last,to,whom,the,affair
is,made,known,when,circumstances,make,the,revealment,of,iteligible
i,would,not,attempt,to,force,the,confidence,of,any,one,of
a,child,much,less,because,a,sense,of,duty,would,prevent,the
denial,which,her,wishes,mightdirect
elinor,thought,this,generosity,overstrained,considering,her,sister,s,youth,and,urged
the,matter,farther,but,in,vain,common,sense,common,care,common,prudence
were,all,sunk,in,mrs,dashwood,s,romanticdelicacy
it,was,several,days,before,willoughby,s,name,was,mentioned,before,marianne
by,any,of,her,family,sir,john,and,mrs,jennings,indeed,were
not,so,nice,their,witticisms,added,pain,to,many,a,painful,hour
but,one,evening,mrs,dashwood,accidentally,taking,up,a,volume,of,shakespeare
exclaimed,we,have,never,finished,_hamlet_,marianne,our,dear,willoughby,went,away
before,we,could,get,throughit
we,will,put,it,by,that,when,he,comes,again,but,it
may,be,months,perhaps,before,_that_happens
months
cried,marianne,with,strongsurprise
no,nor,manyweeks
mrs,dashwood,was,sorry,for,what,she,had,said,but,it,gave
elinor,pleasure,as,it,produced,a,reply,from,marianne,so,expressive,of
confidence,in,willoughby,and,knowledge,of,hisintentions
one,morning,about,a,week,after,his,leaving,the,country,marianne,was
prevailed,on,to,join,her,sisters,in,their,usual,walk,instead,of
wandering,away,byherself
hitherto,she,had,carefully,avoided,every,companion,in,herrambles
if,her,sisters,intended,to,walk,on,the,downs,she,directly,stole
away,towards,the,lanes,if,they,talked,of,the,valley,she,was
as,speedy,in,climbing,the,hills,and,could,never,be,found,when
the,others,setoff
but,at,length,she,was,secured,by,the,exertions,of,elinor,who
greatly,disapproved,such,continualseclusion
they,walked,along,the,road,through,the,valley,and,chiefly,in,silence
for,marianne,s,_mind_,could,not,be,controlled,and,elinor,satisfied,with
gaining,one,point,would,not,then,attemptmore
beyond,the,entrance,of,the,valley,where,the,country,though,still,rich
was,less,wild,and,more,open,a,long,stretch,of,the,road
which,they,had,travelled,on,first,coming,to,barton,lay,before,them
and,on,reaching,that,point,they,stopped,to,look,around,them,and
examine,a,prospect,which,formed,the,distance,of,their,view,from,the
cottage,from,a,spot,which,they,had,never,happened,to,reach,in
any,of,their,walksbefore
amongst,the,objects,in,the,scene,they,soon,discovered,an,animated,one
it,was,a,man,on,horseback,riding,towardsthem
in,a,few,minutes,they,could,distinguish,him,to,be,a,gentleman
and,in,a,moment,afterwards,marianne,rapturously,exclaimed,it,is,he,it
is,indeed,i,know,itis
and,was,hastening,to,meet,him,when,elinor,cried,out,indeed,marianne
i,think,you,aremistaken
it,is,notwilloughby
the,person,is,not,tall,enough,for,him,and,has,not,his
air
he,has,he,has,cried,marianne,i,am,sure,hehas
his,air,his,coat,hishorse
i,knew,how,soon,he,wouldcome
she,walked,eagerly,on,as,she,spoke,and,elinor,to,screen,marianne
from,particularity,as,she,felt,almost,certain,of,its,not,being,willoughby
quickened,her,pace,and,kept,up,withher
they,were,soon,within,thirty,yards,of,thegentleman
marianne,looked,again,her,heart,sunk,within,her,and,abruptly,turning,round
she,was,hurrying,back,when,the,voices,of,both,her,sisters,were
raised,to,detain,her,a,third,almost,as,well,known,as,willoughby
s,joined,them,in,begging,her,to,stop,and,she,turned,round
with,surprise,to,see,and,welcome,edwardferrars
illustration,_begging,her,to,stop,_,he,was,the,only,person,in
the,world,who,could,at,that,moment,be,forgiven,for,not,being
willoughby,the,only,one,who,could,have,gained,a,smile,from,her
but,she,dispersed,her,tears,to,smile,on,_him_,and,in,her
sister,s,happiness,forgot,for,a,time,her,owndisappointment
he,dismounted,and,giving,his,horse,to,his,servant,walked,back,with
them,to,barton,whither,he,was,purposely,coming,to,visitthem
he,was,welcomed,by,them,all,with,great,cordiality,but,especially,by
marianne,who,showed,more,warmth,of,regard,in,her,reception,of,him
than,even,elinorherself
to,marianne,indeed,the,meeting,between,edward,and,her,sister,was,but
a,continuation,of,that,unaccountable,coldness,which,she,had,often,observed,at
norland,in,their,mutualbehaviour
on,edward,s,side,more,particularly,there,was,a,deficiency,of,all
that,a,lover,ought,to,look,and,say,on,such,anoccasion
he,was,confused,seemed,scarcely,sensible,of,pleasure,in,seeing,them,looked
neither,rapturous,nor,gay,said,little,but,what,was,forced,from,him
by,questions,and,distinguished,elinor,by,no,mark,ofaffection
marianne,saw,and,listened,with,increasingsurprise
she,began,almost,to,feel,a,dislike,of,edward,and,it,ended
as,every,feeling,must,end,with,her,by,carrying,back,her,thoughts
to,willoughby,whose,manners,formed,a,contrast,sufficiently,striking,to,those,of
his,brotherelect
after,a,short,silence,which,succeeded,the,first,surprise,and,enquiries,of
meeting,marianne,asked,edward,if,he,came,directly,fromlondon
no,he,had,been,in,devonshire,afortnight
afortnight
she,repeated,surprised,at,his,being,so,long,in,the,same,county
with,elinor,without,seeing,herbefore

now,there,is,no,one,to,regardthem
they,are,seen,only,as,a,nuisance,swept,hastily,off,and,driven

no,my,feelings,are,not,often,shared,not,oftenunderstood

as,she,said,this,she,sunk,into,a,reverie,for,a,few
moments,but,rousing,herself,again,now,edward,said,she,calling,his,attention

elinor,took,no,notice,of,this,and,directing,her,attention,to,their
visitor,endeavoured,to,support,something,like,discourse,with,him,by,talking,of
their,present,residence,its,conveniences,c,extorting,from,him,occasional,questions,and
remarks
his,coldness,and,reserve,mortified,her,severely,she,was,vexed,and,half
angry,but,resolving,to,regulate,her,behaviour,to,him,by,the,past
rather,than,the,present,she,avoided,every,appearance,of,resentment,or,displeasure
and,treated,him,as,she,thought,he,ought,to,be,treated,from
the,familyconnection
chapter,xvii,mrs,dashwood,was,surprised,only,for,a,moment,at,seeing
him,for,his,coming,to,barton,was,in,her,opinion,of,all
things,the,mostnatural

he,received,the,kindest,welcome,from,her,and,shyness,coldness,reserve,could
not,stand,against,such,areception
they,had,begun,to,fail,him,before,he,entered,the,house,and
they,were,quite,overcome,by,the,captivating,manners,of,mrsdashwood
indeed,a,man,could,not,very,well,be,in,love,with,either
of,her,daughters,without,extending,the,passion,to,her,and,elinor,had
the,satisfaction,of,seeing,him,soon,become,more,likehimself
his,affections,seemed,to,reanimate,towards,them,all,and,his,interest,in

sometimes,one,is,guided,by,what,they,say,of,themselves,and,very
frequently,by,what,other,people,say,of,them,without,giving,oneself,time
to,deliberate,andjudge
but,i,thought,it,was,right,elinor,said,marianne,to,be,guided
wholly,by,the,opinion,of,otherpeople

quite,the,contrary,replied,elinor,looking,expressively,atmarianne

edward,made,noanswer
his,gravity,and,thoughtfulness,returned,on,him,in,their,fullest,extent,and
he,sat,for,some,time,silent,anddull
chapter,xviii,elinor,saw,with,great,uneasiness,the,low,spirits,of,her
friend
his,visit,afforded,her,but,a,very,partial,satisfaction,while,his,own
enjoyment,in,it,appeared,soimperfect
it,was,evident,that,he,was,unhappy,she,wished,it,were,equally
evident,that,he,still,distinguished,her,by,the,same,affection,which,once
she,had,felt,no,doubt,of,inspiring,but,hitherto,the,continuance,of
his,preference,seemed,very,uncertain,and,the,reservedness,of,his,manner,towards
her,contradicted,one,moment,what,a,more,animated,look,had,intimated,the
precedingone
he,joined,her,and,marianne,in,the,breakfast,room,the,next,morning
before,the,others,were,down,and,marianne,who,was,always,eager,to
promote,their,happiness,as,far,as,she,could,soon,left,them,to
themselves
but,before,she,was,half,way,upstairs,she,heard,the,parlour,door
open,and,turning,round,was,astonished,to,see,edward,himself,comeout
i,am,going,into,the,village,to,see,my,horses,said,he
as,you,are,not,yet,ready,for,breakfast,i,shall,be,back
againpresently
edward,returned,to,them,with,fresh,admiration,of,the,surrounding,country,in
his,walk,to,the,village,he,had,seen,many,parts,of,the
valley,to,advantage,and,the,village,itself,in,a,much,higher,situation
than,the,cottage,afforded,a,general,view,of,the,whole,which,had
exceedingly,pleasedhim
this,was,a,subject,which,ensured,marianne,s,attention,and,she,was
beginning,to,describe,her,own,admiration,of,these,scenes,and,to,question
him,more,minutely,on,the,objects,that,had,particularly,struck,him,when
edward,interrupted,her,by,saying,you,must,not,enquire,too,far,marianne
remember,i,have,no,knowledge,in,the,picturesque,and,i,shall,offend
you,by,my,ignorance,and,want,of,taste,if,we,come,to
particulars
i,shall,call,hills,steep,which,ought,to,be,bold,surfaces,strange
and,uncouth,which,ought,to,be,irregular,and,rugged,and,distant,objects
out,of,sight,which,ought,only,to,be,indistinct,through,the,soft
medium,of,a,hazyatmosphere
you,must,be,satisfied,with,such,admiration,as,i,can,honestlygive
i,call,it,a,very,fine,country,the,hills,are,steep,the
woods,seem,full,of,fine,timber,and,the,valley,looks,comfortable,and
snug,with,rich,meadows,and,several,neat,farm,houses,scattered,here,and
there
it,exactly,answers,my,idea,of,a,fine,country,because,it,unites
beauty,with,utility,and,i,dare,say,it,is,a,picturesque,one
too,because,you,admire,it,i,can,easily,believe,it,to,be
full,of,rocks,and,promontories,grey,moss,and,brush,wood,but,these
are,all,lost,onme
i,know,nothing,of,thepicturesque
i,am,afraid,it,is,but,too,true,said,marianne,but,why
should,you,boast,ofit
i,suspect,said,elinor,that,to,avoid,one,kind,of,affectation,edward
here,falls,intoanother
because,he,believes,many,people,pretend,to,more,admiration,of,the,beauties
of,nature,than,they,really,feel,and,is,disgusted,with,such,pretensions
he,affects,greater,indifference,and,less,discrimination,in,viewing,them,himself,than
hepossesses
he,is,fastidious,and,will,have,an,affectation,of,hisown
it,is,very,true,said,marianne,that,admiration,of,landscape,scenery,is
become,a,merejargon
every,body,pretends,to,feel,and,tries,to,describe,with,the,taste
and,elegance,of,him,who,first,defined,what,picturesque,beautywas
i,detest,jargon,of,every,kind,and,sometimes,i,have,kept,my
feelings,to,myself,because,i,could,find,no,language,to,describe,them
in,but,what,was,worn,and,hackneyed,out,of,all,sense,and
meaning
i,am,convinced,said,edward,that,you,really,feel,all,the,delight
in,a,fine,prospect,which,you,profess,tofeel
but,in,return,your,sister,must,allow,me,to,feel,no,more
than,iprofess
i,like,a,fine,prospect,but,not,on,picturesqueprinciples
i,do,not,like,crooked,twisted,blastedtrees
i,admire,them,much,more,if,they,are,tall,straight,andflourishing
i,do,not,like,ruined,tatteredcottages
i,am,not,fond,of,nettles,or,thistles,or,heathblossoms
i,have,more,pleasure,in,a,snug,farm,house,than,a,watch
tower,and,a,troop,of,tidy,happy,villages,please,me,better,than
the,finest,banditti,in,theworld
marianne,looked,with,amazement,at,edward,with,compassion,at,hersister
elinor,onlylaughed
the,subject,was,continued,no,farther,and,marianne,remained,thoughtfully,silent,till
a,new,object,suddenly,engaged,herattention
she,was,sitting,by,edward,and,in,taking,his,tea,from,mrs
dashwood,his,hand,passed,so,directly,before,her,as,to,make,a

that,the,hair,was,her,own,she,instantaneously,felt,as,well,satisfied

considered,as,a,free,gift,from,her,sister,elinor,was,conscious,must
have,been,procured,by,some,theft,or,contrivance,unknown,toherself
she,was,not,in,a,humour,however,to,regard,it,as,an
affront,and,affecting,to,take,no,notice,of,what,passed,by,instantly
talking,of,something,else,she,internally,resolved,henceforward,to,catch,every,opportunity
of,eyeing,the,hair,and,of,satisfying,herself,beyond,all,doubt,that

before,the,middle,of,the,day,they,were,visited,by,sir,john

with,the,assistance,of,his,mother,in,law,sir,john,was,not

and,this,prepared,a,future,mine,of,raillery,against,the,devoted,elinor
which,nothing,but,the,newness,of,their,acquaintance,with,edward,could,have
prevented,from,being,immediatelysprung
but,as,it,was,she,only,learned,from,some,very,significant,looks
how,far,their,penetration,founded,on,margaret,s,instructionsextended
sir,john,never,came,to,the,dashwoods,without,either,inviting,them,to

she,gave,him,a,briefreply
marianne,s,countenance,was,morecommunicative
edward,saw,enough,to,comprehend,not,only,the,meaning,of,others,but
such,of,marianne,s,expressions,as,had,puzzled,him,before,and,when

for,the,good,of,her,acquaintance,in,general,founded,only,on,a
something,or,a,nothing,between,mr,willoughby,and,herself,he,would,not
have,ventured,to,mentionit
chapter,xix,edward,remained,a,week,at,the,cottage,he,was,earnestly
pressed,by,mrs,dashwood,to,stay,longer,but,as,if,he,were
bent,only,on,self,mortification,he,seemed,resolved,to,be,gone,when
his,enjoyment,among,his,friends,was,at,theheight
his,spirits,during,the,last,two,or,three,days,though,still,very
unequal,were,greatly,improved,he,grew,more,and,more,partial,to,the
house,and,environs,never,spoke,of,going,away,without,a,sigh,declared
his,time,to,be,wholly,disengaged,even,doubted,to,what,place,he
should,go,when,he,left,them,but,still,go,hemust
never,had,any,week,passed,so,quickly,he,could,hardly,believe,it
to,begone
he,said,so,repeatedly,other,things,he,said,too,which,marked,the
turn,of,his,feelings,and,gave,the,lie,to,hisactions
he,had,no,pleasure,at,norland,he,detested,being,in,town,but
either,to,norland,or,london,he,mustgo
he,valued,their,kindness,beyond,any,thing,and,his,greatest,happiness,was
in,being,withthem
yet,he,must,leave,them,at,the,end,of,a,week,in
spite,of,their,wishes,and,his,own,and,without,any,restraint,on
histime
elinor,placed,all,that,was,astonishing,in,this,way,of,acting,to
his,mother,s,account,and,it,was,happy,for,her,that,he
had,a,mother,whose,character,was,so,imperfectly,known,to,her,as
to,be,the,general,excuse,for,every,thing,strange,on,the,part
of,herson
disappointed,however,and,vexed,as,she,was,and,sometimes,displeased,with,his
uncertain,behaviour,to,herself,she,was,very,well,disposed,on,the,whole
to,regard,his,actions,with,all,the,candid,allowances,and,generous,qualifications
which,had,been,rather,more,painfully,extorted,from,her,for,willoughby,s
service,by,hermother
his,want,of,spirits,of,openness,and,of,consistency,were,most,usually
attributed,to,his,want,of,independence,and,his,better,knowledge,of,mrs
ferrars,s,disposition,anddesigns
the,shortness,of,his,visit,the,steadiness,of,his,purpose,in,leaving
them,originated,in,the,same,fettered,inclination,the,same,inevitable,necessity,of
temporizing,with,hismother
the,old,well,established,grievance,of,duty,against,will,parent,against,child
was,the,cause,ofall
she,would,have,been,glad,to,know,when,these,difficulties,were,to
cease,this,opposition,was,to,yield,when,mrs,ferrars,would,be,reformed
and,her,son,be,at,liberty,to,behappy
but,from,such,vain,wishes,she,was,forced,to,turn,for,comfort
to,the,renewal,of,her,confidence,in,edward,s,affection,to,the
remembrance,of,every,mark,of,regard,in,look,or,word,which,fell
from,him,while,at,barton,and,above,all,to,that,flattering,proof
of,it,which,he,constantly,wore,round,hisfinger
i,think,edward,said,mrs,dashwood,as,they,were,at,breakfast,the
last,morning,you,would,be,a,happier,man,if,you,had,any
profession,to,engage,your,time,and,give,an,interest,to,your,plans
andactions
some,inconvenience,to,your,friends,indeed,might,result,from,it,you,would
not,be,able,to,give,them,so,much,of,yourtime
but,with,a,smile,you,would,be,materially,benefited,in,one,particular
at,least,you,would,know,where,to,go,when,you,leftthem
i,do,assure,you,he,replied,that,i,have,long,thought,on
this,point,as,you,thinknow
it,has,been,and,is,and,probably,will,always,be,a,heavy
misfortune,to,me,that,i,have,had,no,necessary,business,to,engage
me,no,profession,to,give,me,employment,or,afford,me,any,thing
likeindependence
but,unfortunately,my,own,nicety,and,the,nicety,of,my,friends,have
made,me,what,i,am,an,idle,helplessbeing
we,never,could,agree,in,our,choice,of,aprofession
i,always,preferred,the,church,as,i,stilldo
but,that,was,not,smart,enough,for,myfamily
they,recommended,thearmy
that,was,a,great,deal,too,smart,forme
the,law,was,allowed,to,be,genteel,enough,many,young,men,who
had,chambers,in,the,temple,made,a,very,good,appearance,in,the
first,circles,and,drove,about,town,in,very,knowinggigs
but,i,had,no,inclination,for,the,law,even,in,this,less
abstruse,study,of,it,which,my,familyapproved
as,for,the,navy,it,had,fashion,on,its,side,but,i
was,too,old,when,the,subject,was,first,started,to,enter,it
and,at,length,as,there,was,no,necessity,for,my,having,any
profession,at,all,as,i,might,be,as,dashing,and,expensive,without
a,red,coat,on,my,back,as,with,one,idleness,was,pronounced
on,the,whole,to,be,most,advantageous,and,honourable,and,a,young
man,of,eighteen,is,not,in,general,so,earnestly,bent,on,being
busy,as,to,resist,the,solicitations,of,his,friends,to,donothing
i,was,therefore,entered,at,oxford,and,have,been,properly,idle,ever
since
the,consequence,of,which,i,suppose,will,be,said,mrs,dashwood,since
leisure,has,not,promoted,your,own,happiness,that,your,sons,will,be
brought,up,to,as,many,pursuits,employments,professions,and,trades,as,columella
s
they,will,be,brought,up,said,he,in,a,serious,accent,to
be,as,unlike,myself,as,ispossible
in,feeling,in,action,in,condition,in,everything
come,come,this,is,all,an,effusion,of,immediate,want,of,spirits
edward
you,are,in,a,melancholy,humour,and,fancy,that,any,one,unlike
yourself,must,behappy
but,remember,that,the,pain,of,parting,from,friends,will,be,felt
by,every,body,at,times,whatever,be,their,education,orstate
know,your,ownhappiness
you,want,nothing,but,patience,or,give,it,a,more,fascinating,name
call,ithope
your,mother,will,secure,to,you,in,time,that,independence,you,are
so,anxious,for,it,is,her,duty,and,it,will,it,must
ere,long,become,her,happiness,to,prevent,your,whole,youth,from,being
wasted,indiscontent
how,much,may,not,a,few,monthsdo
i,think,replied,edward,that,i,may,defy,many,months,to,produce
any,good,tome
this,desponding,turn,of,mind,though,it,could,not,be,communicated,to
mrs,dashwood,gave,additional,pain,to,them,all,in,the,parting,which
shortly,took,place,and,left,an,uncomfortable,impression,on,elinor,s,feelings
especially,which,required,some,trouble,and,time,tosubdue
but,as,it,was,her,determination,to,subdue,it,and,to,prevent
herself,from,appearing,to,suffer,more,than,what,all,her,family,suffered
on,his,going,away,she,did,not,adopt,the,method,so,judiciously
employed,by,marianne,on,a,similar,occasion,to,augment,and,fix,her
sorrow,by,seeking,silence,solitude,andidleness
their,means,were,as,different,as,their,objects,and,equally,suited,to
the,advancement,ofeach
elinor,sat,down,to,her,drawing,table,as,soon,as,he,was
out,of,the,house,busily,employed,herself,the,whole,day,neither,sought
nor,avoided,the,mention,of,his,name,appeared,to,interest,herself,almost
as,much,as,ever,in,the,general,concerns,of,the,family,and
if,by,this,conduct,she,did,not,lessen,her,own,grief,it
was,at,least,prevented,from,unnecessary,increase,and,her,mother,and,sisters
were,spared,much,solicitude,on,heraccount
such,behaviour,as,this,so,exactly,the,reverse,of,her,own,appeared
no,more,meritorious,to,marianne,than,her,own,had,seemed,faulty,to
her
the,business,of,self,command,she,settled,very,easily,with,strong,affections
it,was,impossible,with,calm,ones,it,could,have,nomerit
that,her,sister,s,affections,_were_,calm,she,dared,not,deny,though
she,blushed,to,acknowledge,it,and,of,the,strength,of,her,own
she,gave,a,very,striking,proof,by,still,loving,and,respecting,that
sister,in,spite,of,this,mortifyingconviction
without,shutting,herself,up,from,her,family,or,leaving,the,house,in
determined,solitude,to,avoid,them,or,lying,awake,the,whole,night,to
indulge,meditation,elinor,found,every,day,afforded,her,leisure,enough,to,think
of,edward,and,of,edward,s,behaviour,in,every,possible,variety,which
the,different,state,of,her,spirits,at,different,times,could,produce,with
tenderness,pity,approbation,censure,anddoubt
there,were,moments,in,abundance,when,if,not,by,the,absence,of
her,mother,and,sisters,at,least,by,the,nature,of,their,employments
conversation,was,forbidden,among,them,and,every,effect,of,solitude,wasproduced
her,mind,was,inevitably,at,liberty,her,thoughts,could,not,be,chained
elsewhere,and,the,past,and,the,future,on,a,subject,so,interesting
must,be,before,her,must,force,her,attention,and,engross,her,memory
her,reflection,and,herfancy
from,a,reverie,of,this,kind,as,she,sat,at,her,drawing
table,she,was,roused,one,morning,soon,after,edward,s,leaving,them
by,the,arrival,ofcompany
she,happened,to,be,quitealone
the,closing,of,the,little,gate,at,the,entrance,of,the,green
court,in,front,of,the,house,drew,her,eyes,to,the,window
and,she,saw,a,large,party,walking,up,to,thedoor
amongst,them,were,sir,john,and,lady,middleton,and,mrs,jennings,but
there,were,two,others,a,gentleman,and,lady,who,were,quite,unknown
toher
she,was,sitting,near,the,window,and,as,soon,as,sir,john
perceived,her,he,left,the,rest,of,the,party,to,the,ceremony
of,knocking,at,the,door,and,stepping,across,the,turf,obliged,her
to,open,the,casement,to,speak,to,him,though,the,space,was
so,short,between,the,door,and,the,window,as,to,make,it
hardly,possible,to,speak,at,one,without,being,heard,at,theother

they,were,now,joined,by,mrs,jennings,who,had,not,patience,enough
to,wait,till,the,door,was,opened,before,she,told,_her_story

elinor,was,obliged,to,turn,from,her,in,the,middle,of,her
story,to,receive,the,rest,of,the,party,lady,middleton,introduced,the
two,strangers,mrs,dashwood,and,margaret,came,down,stairs,at,the,same
time,and,they,all,sat,down,to,look,at,one,another,while
mrs,jennings,continued,her,story,as,she,walked,through,the,passage,into
the,parlour,attended,by,sirjohn
mrs,palmer,was,several,years,younger,than,lady,middleton,and,totally,unlike
her,in,everyrespect
she,was,short,and,plump,had,a,very,pretty,face,and,the
finest,expression,of,good,humour,in,it,that,could,possiblybe
her,manners,were,by,no,means,so,elegant,as,her,sister,s
but,they,were,much,moreprepossessing
she,came,in,with,a,smile,smiled,all,the,time,of,her
visit,except,when,she,laughed,and,smiled,when,she,wentaway
her,husband,was,a,grave,looking,young,man,of,five,or,six
and,twenty,with,an,air,of,more,fashion,and,sense,than,his
wife,but,of,less,willingness,to,please,or,bepleased
he,entered,the,room,with,a,look,of,self,consequence,slightly,bowed
to,the,ladies,without,speaking,a,word,and,after,briefly,surveying,them
and,their,apartments,took,up,a,newspaper,from,the,table,and,continued
to,read,it,as,long,as,hestayed
mrs,palmer,on,the,contrary,who,was,strongly,endowed,by,nature,with
a,turn,for,being,uniformly,civil,and,happy,was,hardly,seated,before
her,admiration,of,the,parlour,and,every,thing,in,it,burstforth
well
what,a,delightful,room,thisis
i,never,saw,anything,socharming
only,think,mamma,how,it,is,improved,since,i,was,herelast

eyes,from,thenewspaper
mr,palmer,does,not,hear,me,said,she,laughing,he,never,does
sometimes
it,is,soridiculous
this,was,quite,a,new,idea,to,mrs,dashwood,she,had,never
been,used,to,find,wit,in,the,inattention,of,any,one,and
could,not,help,looking,with,surprise,at,themboth
mrs,jennings,in,the,meantime,talked,on,as,loud,as,she,could
and,continued,her,account,of,their,surprise,the,evening,before,on,seeing
their,friends,without,ceasing,till,every,thing,wastold
mrs,palmer,laughed,heartily,at,the,recollection,of,their,astonishment,and,every
body,agreed,two,or,three,times,over,that,it,had,been,quite
an,agreeablesurprise
you,may,believe,how,glad,we,all,were,to,see,them,added
mrs,jennings,leaning,forward,towards,elinor,and,speaking,in,a,low,voice
as,if,she,meant,to,be,heard,by,no,one,else,though
they,were,seated,on,different,sides,of,the,room,but,however,i
can,t,help,wishing,they,had,not,travelled,quite,so,fast,nor
made,such,a,long,journey,of,it,for,they,came,all,round

she,would,come,with,us,she,longed,so,much,to,see,you

mrs,palmer,laughed,and,said,it,would,not,do,her,anyharm
she,expects,to,be,confined,in,february,continued,mrsjennings
lady,middleton,could,no,longer,endure,such,a,conversation,and,therefore,exerted
herself,to,ask,mr,palmer,if,there,was,any,news,in,the

mrs,jennings,asked,her,as,soon,as,she,appeared,if,she,had
not,been,to,allenham,and,mrs,palmer,laughed,so,heartily,at,the
question,as,to,show,she,understoodit
mr,palmer,looked,up,on,her,entering,the,room,stared,at,her
some,minutes,and,then,returned,to,hisnewspaper

when,lady,middleton,rose,to,go,away,mr,palmer,rose,also,laid
down,the,newspaper,stretched,himself,and,looked,at,them,allaround

he,made,her,no,answer,and,only,observed,after,again,examining,the
room,that,it,was,very,low,pitched,and,that,the,ceiling,was
crooked
he,then,made,his,bow,and,departed,with,therest
sir,john,had,been,very,urgent,with,them,all,to,spend,the

but,they,had,no,curiosity,to,see,how,mr,and,mrs,palmer
ate,their,dinner,and,no,expectation,of,pleasure,from,them,in,any

they,attempted,therefore,likewise,to,excuse,themselves,the,weather,was,uncertain,and
not,likely,to,begood

delight,in,seeing,themagain

know
it,was,quite,a,sudden,thing,our,coming,at,all,and,i
knew,nothing,of,it,till,the,carriage,was,coming,to,the,door
and,then,mr,palmer,asked,me,if,i,would,go,with,him
tobarton
he,is,sodroll
he,never,tells,me,anything
i,am,so,sorry,we,cannot,stay,longer,however,we,shall,meet

they,were,obliged,to,put,an,end,to,such,anexpectation

you,donot
i,could,get,the,nicest,house,in,world,for,you,next,door
to,ours,in,hanoversquare

i,am,sure,i,shall,be,very,happy,to,chaperon,you,at
any,time,till,i,am,confined,if,mrs,dashwood,should,not,like
to,go,intopublic
they,thanked,her,but,were,obliged,to,resist,all,herentreaties
oh,my,love,cried,mrs,palmer,to,her,husband,who,just,then
entered,the,room,you,must,help,me,to,persuade,the,miss,dashwoods
to,go,to,town,thiswinter
her,love,made,no,answer,and,after,slightly,bowing,to,the,ladies
began,complaining,of,theweather
how,horrid,all,thisis
saidhe
such,weather,makes,every,thing,and,every,bodydisgusting
dullness,is,as,much,produced,within,doors,as,without,byrain
it,makes,one,detest,all,one,sacquaintance
what,the,devil,does,sir,john,mean,by,not,having,a,billiard
room,in,hishouse
how,few,people,know,what,comfortis
sir,john,is,as,stupid,as,theweather
the,rest,of,the,company,soon,droptin
i,am,afraid,miss,marianne,said,sir,john,you,have,not,been
able,to,take,your,usual,walk,to,allenhamtoday
marianne,looked,very,grave,and,saidnothing
oh,don,t,be,so,sly,before,us,said,mrs,palmer,for
we,know,all,about,it,i,assure,you,and,i,admire,your
taste,very,much,for,i,think,he,is,extremelyhandsome
we,do,not,live,a,great,way,from,him,in,the,country
youknow
not,above,ten,miles,i,daresay
much,nearer,thirty,said,herhusband
ahwell
there,is,not,muchdifference
i,never,was,at,his,house,but,they,say,it,is,a
sweet,prettyplace
as,vile,a,spot,as,i,ever,saw,in,my,life,said
mrpalmer
marianne,remained,perfectly,silent,though,her,countenance,betrayed,her,interest,in,what
wassaid
is,it,veryugly
continued,mrs,palmer,then,it,must,be,some,other,place,that,is
so,pretty,isuppose
when,they,were,seated,in,the,dining,room,sir,john,observed,with
regret,that,they,were,only,eight,alltogether
my,dear,said,he,to,his,lady,it,is,very,provoking,that
we,should,be,sofew
why,did,not,you,ask,the,gilberts,to,come,to,ustoday
did,not,i,tell,you,sir,john,when,you,spoke,to,me
about,it,before,that,it,could,not,bedone
they,dined,with,uslast
you,and,i,sir,john,said,mrs,jennings,should,not,stand,upon
suchceremony
then,you,would,be,very,ill,bred,cried,mrpalmer
my,love,you,contradict,every,body,said,his,wife,with,her,usual
laugh
do,you,know,that,you,are,quiterude
i,did,not,know,i,contradicted,any,body,in,calling,your,mother
illbred
ay,you,may,abuse,me,as,you,please,said,the,good,natured
old,lady,you,have,taken,charlotte,off,my,hands,and,cannot,give
her,backagain
so,there,i,have,the,whip,hand,ofyou
charlotte,laughed,heartily,to,think,that,her,husband,could,not,get,rid
of,her,and,exultingly,said,she,did,not,care,how,cross,he
was,to,her,as,they,must,livetogether
it,was,impossible,for,any,one,to,be,more,thoroughly,good,natured
or,more,determined,to,be,happy,than,mrspalmer
the,studied,indifference,insolence,and,discontent,of,her,husband,gave,her,no
pain,and,when,he,scolded,or,abused,her,she,was,highlydiverted
mr,palmer,is,sodroll
said,she,in,a,whisper,toelinor
he,is,always,out,ofhumour
elinor,was,not,inclined,after,a,little,observation,to,give,him,credit
for,being,so,genuinely,and,unaffectedly,ill,natured,or,ill,bred,as
he,wished,toappear
his,temper,might,perhaps,be,a,little,soured,by,finding,like,many
others,of,his,sex,that,through,some,unaccountable,bias,in,favour,of
beauty,he,was,the,husband,of,a,very,silly,woman,but,she
knew,that,this,kind,of,blunder,was,too,common,for,any,sensible
man,to,be,lastingly,hurt,byit
it,was,rather,a,wish,of,distinction,she,believed,which,produced,his
contemptuous,treatment,of,every,body,and,his,general,abuse,of,every,thing
beforehim
it,was,the,desire,of,appearing,superior,to,otherpeople
the,motive,was,too,common,to,be,wondered,at,but,the,means
however,they,might,succeed,by,establishing,his,superiority,in,ill,breeding,were
not,likely,to,attach,any,one,to,him,except,hiswife
oh,my,dear,miss,dashwood,said,mrs,palmer,soon,afterwards,i,have
got,such,a,favour,to,ask,of,you,and,yoursister
will,you,come,and,spend,some,time,at,cleveland,thischristmas
now,pray,do,and,come,while,the,westons,are,withus
you,cannot,think,how,happy,i,shallbe
it,will,be,quite,delightful,my,love,applying,to,her,husband,don
t,you,long,to,have,the,miss,dashwoods,come,tocleveland
certainly,he,replied,with,a,sneer,i,came,into,devonshire,with,no
otherview
there,now,said,his,lady,you,see,mr,palmer,expects,you,so
you,cannot,refuse,tocome
they,both,eagerly,and,resolutely,declined,herinvitation
but,indeed,you,must,and,shallcome
i,am,sure,you,will,like,it,of,allthings
the,westons,will,be,with,us,and,it,will,be,quitedelightful
you,cannot,think,what,a,sweet,place,cleveland,is,and,we,are
so,gay,now,for,mr,palmer,is,always,going,about,the,country
canvassing,against,the,election,and,so,many,people,came,to,dine,with
us,that,i,never,saw,before,it,is,quitecharming
but,poorfellow
it,is,very,fatiguing,tohim
for,he,is,forced,to,make,every,body,likehim
elinor,could,hardly,keep,her,countenance,as,she,assented,to,the,hardship
of,such,anobligation
how,charming,it,will,be,said,charlotte,when,he,is,in,parliament
won,tit
how,i,shalllaugh
it,will,be,so,ridiculous,to,see,all,his,letters,directed,to
him,with,an,mp
but,do,you,know,he,says,he,will,never,frank,forme
he,declares,he,wont
don,t,youmr
palmer
mr,palmer,took,no,notice,ofher
he,cannot,bear,writing,you,know,she,continued,he,says,it,is
quiteshocking
no,said,he,i,never,said,any,thing,soirrational
don,t,palm,all,your,abuses,of,languages,uponme
there,now,you,see,how,droll,heis
this,is,always,the,way,withhim
sometimes,he,won,t,speak,to,me,for,half,a,day,together
and,then,he,comes,out,with,something,so,droll,all,about,any
thing,in,theworld
she,surprised,elinor,very,much,as,they,returned,into,the,drawing,room
by,asking,her,whether,she,did,not,like,mr,palmerexcessively
certainly,said,elinor,he,seems,veryagreeable
well,i,am,so,glad,youdo
i,thought,you,would,he,is,so,pleasant,and,mr,palmer,is
excessively,pleased,with,you,and,your,sisters,i,can,tell,you,and
you,can,t,think,how,disappointed,he,will,be,if,you,don
t,come,tocleveland
i,can,t,imagine,why,you,should,object,toit
elinor,was,again,obliged,to,decline,her,invitation,and,by,changing,the
subject,put,a,stop,to,herentreaties
she,thought,it,probable,that,as,they,lived,in,the,same,county
mrs,palmer,might,be,able,to,give,some,more,particular,account,of
willoughby,s,general,character,than,could,be,gathered,from,the,middletons,partial
acquaintance,with,him,and,she,was,eager,to,gain,from,any,one
such,a,confirmation,of,his,merits,as,might,remove,the,possibility,of
fear,frommarianne
she,began,by,inquiring,if,they,saw,much,of,mr,willoughby,at
cleveland,and,whether,they,were,intimately,acquainted,withhim
oh,dear,yes,i,know,him,extremely,well,replied,mrs,palmer,not
that,i,ever,spoke,to,him,indeed,but,i,have,seen,him
for,ever,intown
somehow,or,other,i,never,happened,to,be,staying,at,barton,while
he,was,atallenham
mama,saw,him,here,once,before,but,i,was,with,my,uncle
atweymouth
however,i,dare,say,we,should,have,seen,a,great,deal,of
him,in,somersetshire,if,it,had,not,happened,very,unluckily,that,we
should,never,have,been,in,the,countrytogether
he,is,very,little,at,combe,i,believe,but,if,he,were
ever,so,much,there,i,do,not,think,mr,palmer,would,visit
him,for,he,is,in,the,opposition,you,know,and,besides,it
is,such,a,wayoff
i,know,why,you,inquire,about,him,very,well,your,sister,is
to,marryhim
i,am,monstrous,glad,of,it,for,then,i,shall,have,her
for,a,neighbour,youknow
upon,my,word,replied,elinor,you,know,much,more,of,the,matter
than,i,do,if,you,have,any,reason,to,expect,such,a
match
don,t,pretend,to,deny,it,because,you,know,it,is,what
every,body,talksof
i,assure,you,i,heard,of,it,in,my,way,throughtown
my,dearmrs

upon,my,honour,idid

left,town,and,he,told,me,of,itdirectly
you,surprise,me,verymuch
colonel,brandon,tell,you,ofit
surely,you,must,bemistaken
to,give,such,intelligence,to,a,person,who,could,not,be,interested
in,it,even,if,it,were,true,is,not,what,i,should
expect,colonel,brandon,todo
but,i,do,assure,you,it,was,so,for,all,that,and
i,will,tell,you,how,ithappened
when,we,met,him,he,turned,back,and,walked,with,us,and
so,we,began,talking,of,my,brother,and,sister,and,one,thing

new,family,come,to,barton,cottage,i,hear,and,mama,sends,me

solately
and,what,did,the,colonelsay
oh,he,did,not,say,much,but,he,looked,as,if,he
knew,it,to,be,true,so,from,that,moment,i,set,it
down,ascertain
it,will,be,quite,delightful,ideclare
when,is,it,to,takeplace
mr,brandon,was,very,well,ihope
oh
yes,quite,well,and,so,full,of,your,praises,he,did,nothing
but,say,fine,things,ofyou
i,am,flattered,by,hiscommendation
he,seems,an,excellent,man,and,i,think,him,uncommonlypleasing
so,doi
he,is,such,a,charming,man,that,it,is,quite,a,pity
he,should,be,so,grave,and,sodull
mamma,says,_he_,was,in,love,with,your,sistertoo
i,assure,you,it,was,a,great,compliment,if,he,was,for
he,hardly,ever,falls,in,love,with,anybody

saidelinor
oh

acquainted,with,him,because,combe,magna,is,so,far,off,but,they
all,think,him,extremely,agreeable,i,assureyou
nobody,is,more,liked,than,mr,willoughby,wherever,he,goes,and,so
you,may,tell,yoursister
she,is,a,monstrous,lucky,girl,to,get,him,upon,my,honour
not,but,that,he,is,much,more,lucky,in,getting,her,because
she,is,so,very,handsome,and,agreeable,that,nothing,can,be,good
enough,forher
however,i,don,t,think,her,hardly,at,all,handsomer,than,you
i,assure,you,for,i,think,you,both,excessively,pretty,and,so
does,mr,palmer,too,i,am,sure,though,we,could,not,get
him,to,own,it,lastnight
mrs,palmer,s,information,respecting,willoughby,was,not,very,material,but,any
testimony,in,his,favour,however,small,was,pleasing,toher
i,am,so,glad,we,are,got,acquainted,at,last,continuedcharlotte
and,now,i,hope,we,shall,always,be,greatfriends
you,can,t,think,how,much,i,longed,to,seeyou
it,is,so,delightful,that,you,should,live,at,thecottage
nothing,can,be,like,it,to,besure
and,i,am,so,glad,your,sister,is,going,to,be,well
married
i,hope,you,will,be,a,great,deal,at,combemagna
it,is,a,sweet,place,by,allaccounts
you,have,been,long,acquainted,with,colonel,brandon,have,notyou
yes,a,great,while,ever,since,my,sistermarried
he,was,a,particular,friend,of,sir,johns
i,believe,she,added,in,a,low,voice,he,would,have,been
very,glad,to,have,had,me,if,hecould
sir,john,and,lady,middleton,wished,it,verymuch
but,mama,did,not,think,the,match,good,enough,for,me,otherwise
sir,john,would,have,mentioned,it,to,the,colonel,and,we,should
have,been,marriedimmediately
did,not,colonel,brandon,know,of,sir,john,s,proposal,to,your
mother,before,it,wasmade
had,he,never,owned,his,affection,toyourself
oh,no,but,if,mama,had,not,objected,to,it,i,dare
say,he,would,have,liked,it,of,allthings
he,had,not,seen,me,then,above,twice,for,it,was,before
i,leftschool
however,i,am,much,happier,as,iam
mr,palmer,is,the,kind,of,man,ilike
chapter,xxi,the,palmers,returned,to,cleveland,the,next,day,and,the
two,families,at,barton,were,again,left,to,entertain,eachother
but,this,did,not,last,long,elinor,had,hardly,got,their,last
visitors,out,of,her,head,had,hardly,done,wondering,at,charlotte,s
being,so,happy,without,a,cause,at,mr,palmer,s,acting,so
simply,with,good,abilities,and,at,the,strange,unsuitableness,which,often,existed
between,husband,and,wife,before,sir,john,s,and,mrs,jennings,s
active,zeal,in,the,cause,of,society,procured,her,some,other,new
acquaintance,to,see,andobserve
in,a,morning,s,excursion,to,exeter,they,had,met,with,two
young,ladies,whom,mrs,jennings,had,the,satisfaction,of,discovering,to,be
her,relations,and,this,was,enough,for,sir,john,to,invite,them
directly,to,the,park,as,soon,as,their,present,engagements,at,exeter
wereover
their,engagements,at,exeter,instantly,gave,way,before,such,an,invitation,and
lady,middleton,was,thrown,into,no,little,alarm,on,the,return,of
sir,john,by,hearing,that,she,was,very,soon,to,receive,a
visit,from,two,girls,whom,she,had,never,seen,in,her,life
and,of,whose,elegance,whose,tolerable,gentility,even,she,could,have,no
proof,for,the,assurances,of,her,husband,and,mother,on,that,subject
went,for,nothing,atall
their,being,her,relations,too,made,it,so,much,the,worse,and
mrs,jennings,s,attempts,at,consolation,were,therefore,unfortunately,founded,when,she
advised,her,daughter,not,to,care,about,their,being,so,fashionable,because
they,were,all,cousins,and,must,put,up,with,oneanother
as,it,was,impossible,however,now,to,prevent,their,coming,lady,middleton
resigned,herself,to,the,idea,of,it,with,all,the,philosophy,of
a,well,bred,woman,contenting,herself,with,merely,giving,her,husband,a
gentle,reprimand,on,the,subject,five,or,six,times,everyday
the,young,ladies,arrived,their,appearance,was,by,no,means,ungenteel,or
unfashionable
their,dress,was,very,smart,their,manners,very,civil,they,were,delighted
with,the,house,and,in,raptures,with,the,furniture,and,they,happened
to,be,so,doatingly,fond,of,children,that,lady,middleton,s,good
opinion,was,engaged,in,their,favour,before,they,had,been,an,hour
at,thepark
she,declared,them,to,be,very,agreeable,girls,indeed,which,for,her
ladyship,was,enthusiasticadmiration
sir,john,s,confidence,in,his,own,judgment,rose,with,this,animated
praise,and,he,set,off,directly,for,the,cottage,to,tell,the
miss,dashwoods,of,the,miss,steeles,arrival,and,to,assure,them,of
their,being,the,sweetest,girls,in,theworld
from,such,commendation,as,this,however,there,was,not,much,to,be
learned,elinor,well,knew,that,the,sweetest,girls,in,the,world,were
to,be,met,with,in,every,part,of,england,under,every,possible
variation,of,form,face,temper,andunderstanding
sir,john,wanted,the,whole,family,to,walk,to,the,park,directly
and,look,at,hisguests
benevolent,philanthropicman
it,was,painful,to,him,even,to,keep,a,third,cousin,to
himself
do,come,now,said,he,pray,come,you,must,come,i,declare
you,shall,come,you,can,t,think,how,you,will,likethem
lucy,is,monstrous,pretty,and,so,good,humoured,andagreeable
the,children,are,all,hanging,about,her,already,as,if,she,was
an,oldacquaintance
and,they,both,long,to,see,you,of,all,things,for,they
have,heard,at,exeter,that,you,are,the,most,beautiful,creatures,in
the,world,and,i,have,told,them,it,is,all,very,true
and,a,great,dealmore
you,will,be,delighted,with,them,i,amsure
they,have,brought,the,whole,coach,full,of,playthings,for,thechildren
how,can,you,be,so,cross,as,not,tocome
why,they,are,your,cousins,you,know,after,afashion
_you_,are,my,cousins,and,they,are,my,wife,s,so,you
must,berelated
but,sir,john,could,notprevail
he,could,only,obtain,a,promise,of,their,calling,at,the,park
within,a,day,or,two,and,then,left,them,in,amazement,at
their,indifference,to,walk,home,and,boast,anew,of,their,attractions,to
the,miss,steeles,as,he,had,been,already,boasting,of,the,miss
steeles,tothem
when,their,promised,visit,to,the,park,and,consequent,introduction,to,these
young,ladies,took,place,they,found,in,the,appearance,of,the,eldest
who,was,nearly,thirty,with,a,very,plain,and,not,a,sensible
face,nothing,to,admire,but,in,the,other,who,was,not,more
than,two,or,three,and,twenty,they,acknowledged,considerable,beauty,her,features
were,pretty,and,she,had,a,sharp,quick,eye,and,a,smartness
of,air,which,though,it,did,not,give,actual,elegance,or,grace
gave,distinction,to,herperson
their,manners,were,particularly,civil,and,elinor,soon,allowed,them,credit,for
some,kind,of,sense,when,she,saw,with,what,constant,and,judicious
attention,they,were,making,themselves,agreeable,to,ladymiddleton
with,her,children,they,were,in,continual,raptures,extolling,their,beauty,courting
their,notice,and,humouring,their,whims,and,such,of,their,time,as
could,be,spared,from,the,importunate,demands,which,this,politeness,made,on
it,was,spent,in,admiration,of,whatever,her,ladyship,was,doing,if
she,happened,to,be,doing,any,thing,or,in,taking,patterns,of
some,elegant,new,dress,in,which,her,appearance,the,day,before,had
thrown,them,into,unceasingdelight
fortunately,for,those,who,pay,their,court,through,such,foibles,a,fond
mother,though,in,pursuit,of,praise,for,her,children,the,most,rapacious
of,human,beings,is,likewise,the,most,credulous,her,demands,are,exorbitant
but,she,will,swallow,any,thing,and,the,excessive,affection,and,endurance
of,the,miss,steeles,towards,her,offspring,were,viewed,therefore,by,lady
middleton,without,the,smallest,surprise,ordistrust
she,saw,with,maternal,complacency,all,the,impertinent,encroachments,and,mischievous,tricks
to,which,her,cousinssubmitted
she,saw,their,sashes,untied,their,hair,pulled,about,their,ears,their
work,bags,searched,and,their,knives,and,scissors,stolen,away,and,felt
no,doubt,of,its,being,a,reciprocalenjoyment
it,suggested,no,other,surprise,than,that,elinor,and,marianne,should,sit
so,composedly,by,without,claiming,a,share,in,what,waspassing
john,is,in,such,spiritstoday
said,she,on,his,taking,miss,steele,s,pocket,handkerchief,and,throwing
it,out,of,window,he,is,full,of,monkeytricks
and,soon,afterwards,on,the,second,boy,s,violently,pinching,one,of
the,same,lady,s,fingers,she,fondly,observed,how,playful,williamis
illustration,_mischievous,tricks,_,and,here,is,my,sweet,little,annamaria,she
added,tenderly,caressing,a,little,girl,of,three,years,old,who,had
not,made,a,noise,for,the,last,two,minutes,and,she,is
always,so,gentle,and,quiet,never,was,there,such,a,quiet,little
thing
but,unfortunately,in,bestowing,these,embraces,a,pin,in,her,ladyship,s
head,dress,slightly,scratching,the,child,s,neck,produced,from,this,pattern
of,gentleness,such,violent,screams,as,could,hardly,be,outdone,by,any
creature,professedlynoisy
the,mother,s,consternation,was,excessive,but,it,could,not,surpass,the
alarm,of,the,miss,steeles,and,every,thing,was,done,by,all
three,in,so,critical,an,emergency,which,affection,could,suggest,as,likely
to,assuage,the,agonies,of,the,littlesufferer
she,was,seated,in,her,mother,s,lap,covered,with,kisses,her
wound,bathed,with,lavender,water,by,one,of,the,miss,steeles,who
was,on,her,knees,to,attend,her,and,her,mouth,stuffed,with
sugar,plums,by,theother

some,apricot,marmalade,had,been,successfully,applied,for,a,bruised,temple,the
same,remedy,was,eagerly,proposed,for,this,unfortunate,scratch,and,a,slight
intermission,of,screams,in,the,young,lady,on,hearing,it,gave,them
reason,to,hope,that,it,would,not,berejected
she,was,carried,out,of,the,room,therefore,in,her,mother,s
arms,in,quest,of,this,medicine,and,as,the,two,boys,chose
to,follow,though,earnestly,entreated,by,their,mother,to,stay,behind,the

it,might,have,been,a,very,sadaccident

nothing,to,be,alarmed,at,inreality
what,a,sweet,woman,lady,middletonis
said,lucysteele
marianne,was,silent,it,was,impossible,for,her,to,say,what,she
did,not,feel,however,trivial,the,occasion,and,upon,elinor,therefore,the

i,never,saw,such,fine,children,in,mylife
i,declare,i,quite,doat,upon,them,already,and,indeed,i,am
always,distractedly,fond,ofchildren
i,should,guess,so,said,elinor,with,a,smile,from,what,i
have,witnessed,thismorning
i,have,a,notion,said,lucy,you,think,the,little,middletons,rather
too,much,indulged,perhaps,they,may,be,the,outside,of,enough,but
it,is,so,natural,in,lady,middleton,and,for,my,part,i
love,to,see,children,full,of,life,and,spirits,i,cannot,bear
them,if,they,are,tame,andquiet
i,confess,replied,elinor,that,while,i,am,at,barton,park,i
never,think,of,tame,and,quiet,children,with,anyabhorrence
a,short,pause,succeeded,this,speech,which,was,first,broken,by,miss

rather,abruptly,and,how,do,you,like,devonshire,missdashwood
i,suppose,you,were,very,sorry,to,leavesussex
in,some,surprise,at,the,familiarity,of,this,question,or,at,least
of,the,manner,in,which,it,was,spoken,elinor,replied,that,she

we,have,heard,sir,john,admire,it,excessively,said,lucy,who,seemed
to,think,some,apology,necessary,for,the,freedom,of,hersister

i,suppose,you,have,not,so,many,in,this,part,of,the

that,there,are,not,as,many,genteel,young,men,in,devonshire,as
sussex
nay,my,dear,i,m,sure,i,don,t,pretend,to,say
that,there,ant
i,m,sure,there,s,a,vast,many,smart,beaux,in,exeter
but,you,know,how,could,i,tell,what,smart,beaux,there,might
be,about,norland,and,i,was,only,afraid,the,miss,dashwoods,might
find,it,dull,at,barton,if,they,had,not,so,many,as
they,used,tohave
but,perhaps,you,young,ladies,may,not,care,about,the,beaux,and
had,as,lief,be,without,them,as,withthem
for,my,part,i,think,they,are,vastly,agreeable,provided,they,dress

she,left,the,house,without,any,wish,of,knowing,thembetter
not,so,the,misssteeles
they,came,from,exeter,well,provided,with,admiration,for,the,use,of
sir,john,middleton,his,family,and,all,his,relations,and,no,niggardly
proportion,was,now,dealt,out,to,his,fair,cousins,whom,they,declared
to,be,the,most,beautiful,elegant,accomplished,and,agreeable,girls,they,had
ever,beheld,and,with,whom,they,were,particularly,anxious,to,be,better
acquainted
and,to,be,better,acquainted,therefore,elinor,soon,found,was,their,inevitable

kind,of,intimacy,must,be,submitted,to,which,consists,of,sitting,an
hour,or,two,together,in,the,same,room,almost,everyday
sir,john,could,do,no,more,but,he,did,not,know,that
any,more,was,required,to,be,together,was,in,his,opinion,to
be,intimate,and,while,his,continual,schemes,for,their,meeting,were,effectual
he,had,not,a,doubt,of,their,being,establishedfriends
to,do,him,justice,he,did,every,thing,in,his,power,to
promote,their,unreserve,by,making,the,miss,steeles,acquainted,with,whatever,he
knew,or,supposed,of,his,cousins,situations,in,the,most,delicate,particulars
and,elinor,had,not,seen,them,more,than,twice,before,the,eldest

and,i,hope,you,may,have,as,good,luck,yourself,soon,but
perhaps,you,may,have,a,friend,in,the,corneralready
elinor,could,not,suppose,that,sir,john,would,be,more,nice,in
proclaiming,his,suspicions,of,her,regard,for,edward,than,he,had,been
with,respect,to,marianne,indeed,it,was,rather,his,favourite,joke,of
the,two,as,being,somewhat,newer,and,more,conjectural,and,since,edward

the,miss,steeles,as,she,expected,had,now,all,the,benefit,of
these,jokes,and,in,the,eldest,of,them,they,raised,a,curiosity
to,know,the,name,of,the,gentleman,alluded,to,which,though,often
impertinently,expressed,was,perfectly,of,a,piece,with,her,general,inquisitiveness,into
the,concerns,of,theirfamily

she,wished,very,much,to,have,the,subject,continued,though,she,did
not,choose,to,join,in,it,herself,but,nothing,more,of,it
was,said,and,for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,thought
mrs,jennings,deficient,either,in,curiosity,after,petty,information,or,in,a
disposition,to,communicateit
the,manner,in,which,miss,steele,had,spoken,of,edward,increased,her
curiosity,for,it,struck,her,as,being,rather,ill,natured,and,suggested
the,suspicion,of,that,lady,s,knowing,or,fancying,herself,to,know
something,to,hisdisadvantage
but,her,curiosity,was,unavailing,for,no,farther,notice,was,taken,of

openly,mentioned,by,sirjohn
chapter,xxii,marianne,who,had,never,much,toleration,for,any,thing,like
impertinence,vulgarity,inferiority,of,parts,or,even,difference,of,taste,from,herself
was,at,this,time,particularly,ill,disposed,from,the,state,of,her
spirits,to,be,pleased,with,the,miss,steeles,or,to,encourage,their
advances,and,to,the,invariable,coldness,of,her,behaviour,towards,them,which
checked,every,endeavour,at,intimacy,on,their,side,elinor,principally,attributed,that
preference,of,herself,which,soon,became,evident,in,the,manners,of,both
but,especially,of,lucy,who,missed,no,opportunity,of,engaging,her,in
conversation,or,of,striving,to,improve,their,acquaintance,by,an,easy,and
frank,communication,of,hersentiments
lucy,was,naturally,clever,her,remarks,were,often,just,and,amusing,and
as,a,companion,for,half,an,hour,elinor,frequently,found,her,agreeable
but,her,powers,had,received,no,aid,from,education,she,was,ignorant
and,illiterate,and,her,deficiency,of,all,mental,improvement,her,want,of
information,in,the,most,common,particulars,could,not,be,concealed,from,miss

elinor,saw,and,pitied,her,for,the,neglect,of,abilities,which,education
might,have,rendered,so,respectable,but,she,saw,with,less,tenderness,of
feeling,the,thorough,want,of,delicacy,of,rectitude,and,integrity,of,mind
which,her,attentions,her,assiduities,her,flatteries,at,the,park,betrayed,and
she,could,have,no,lasting,satisfaction,in,the,company,of,a,person
who,joined,insincerity,with,ignorance,whose,want,of,instruction,prevented,their,meeting
in,conversation,on,terms,of,equality,and,whose,conduct,toward,others,made
every,show,of,attention,and,deference,towards,herself,perfectlyvalueless

elinor,made,her,a,civil,reply,and,they,walked,on,for,a
few,minutes,insilence
it,was,broken,by,lucy,who,renewed,the,subject,again,by,saying
with,some,hesitation,i,cannot,bear,to,have,you,think,me,impertinently
curious
i,am,sure,i,would,rather,do,any,thing,in,the,world
than,be,thought,so,by,a,person,whose,good,opinion,is,so
well,worth,having,asyours
and,i,am,sure,i,should,not,have,the,smallest,fear,of
trusting,_you_,indeed,i,should,be,very,glad,of,your,advice,how

i,was,very,unwilling,to,enter,into,it,as,you,may,imagine
without,the,knowledge,and,approbation,of,his,mother,but,i,was,too
young,and,loved,him,too,well,to,be,so,prudent,as,i

something,in,her,countenance,perhaps,the,falsehood,of,the,greatest,part,of

as,if,you,was,an,oldacquaintance

as,she,said,this,she,looked,directly,at,hercompanion

to,stay,more,than,a,fortnight,with,us,and,seeing,me,so

be,authorised,by,nothing,else,for,a,few,moments,she,was,almost
overcome,her,heart,sunk,within,her,and,she,could,hardly,stand,but
exertion,was,indispensably,necessary,and,she,struggled,so,resolutely,against,the,oppression
of,her,feelings,that,her,success,was,speedy,and,for,the,time
complete
writing,to,each,other,said,lucy,returning,the,letter,into,her,pocket

it,in,the,present,case,where,no,temptation,could,be,answerable,to
the,folly,of,inventing,a,falsehood,of,such,adescription

which,if,rationally,spent,give,such,improvement,to,the,understanding,must,have
opened,his,eyes,to,her,defects,of,education,while,the,same,period
of,time,spent,on,her,side,in,inferior,society,and,more,frivolous
pursuits,had,perhaps,robbed,her,of,that,simplicity,which,might,once,have
given,an,interesting,character,to,herbeauty
if,in,the,supposition,of,his,seeking,to,marry,herself,his,difficulties
from,his,mother,had,seemed,great,how,much,greater,were,they,now
likely,to,be,when,the,object,of,his,engagement,was,undoubtedly,inferior
in,connections,and,probably,inferior,in,fortune,toherself
these,difficulties,indeed,with,a,heart,so,alienated,from,lucy,might,not
press,very,hard,upon,his,patience,but,melancholy,was,the,state,of
the,person,by,whom,the,expectation,of,family,opposition,and,unkindness,could
be,felt,as,arelief
as,these,considerations,occurred,to,her,in,painful,succession,she,wept,for
him,more,than,forherself
supported,by,the,conviction,of,having,done,nothing,to,merit,her,present
unhappiness,and,consoled,by,the,belief,that,edward,had,done,nothing,to
forfeit,her,esteem,she,thought,she,could,even,now,under,the,first
smart,of,the,heavy,blow,command,herself,enough,to,guard,every,suspicion
of,the,truth,from,her,mother,andsisters
and,so,well,was,she,able,to,answer,her,own,expectations,that
when,she,joined,them,at,dinner,only,two,hours,after,she,had
first,suffered,the,extinction,of,all,her,dearest,hopes,no,one,would
have,supposed,from,the,appearance,of,the,sisters,that,elinor,was,mourning
in,secret,over,obstacles,which,must,divide,her,for,ever,from,the
object,of,her,love,and,that,marianne,was,internally,dwelling,on,the
perfections,of,a,man,of,whose,whole,heart,she,felt,thoroughly,possessed
and,whom,she,expected,to,see,in,every,carriage,which,drove,near
theirhouse
the,necessity,of,concealing,from,her,mother,and,marianne,what,had,been
entrusted,in,confidence,to,herself,though,it,obliged,her,to,unceasing,exertion
was,no,aggravation,of,elinor,sdistress
on,the,contrary,it,was,a,relief,to,her,to,be,spared
the,communication,of,what,would,give,such,affliction,to,them,and,to
be,saved,likewise,from,hearing,that,condemnation,of,edward,which,would,probably
flow,from,the,excess,of,their,partial,affection,for,herself,and,which
was,more,than,she,felt,equal,tosupport
from,their,counsel,or,their,conversation,she,knew,she,could,receive,no
assistance,their,tenderness,and,sorrow,must,add,to,her,distress,while,her
self,command,would,neither,receive,encouragement,from,their,example,nor,from,their
praise
she,was,stronger,alone,and,her,own,good,sense,so,well,supported
her,that,her,firmness,was,as,unshaken,her,appearance,of,cheerfulness,as
invariable,as,with,regrets,so,poignant,and,so,fresh,it,was,possible
for,them,tobe
much,as,she,had,suffered,from,her,first,conversation,with,lucy,on
the,subject,she,soon,felt,an,earnest,wish,of,renewing,it,and
this,for,more,reasons,thanone
she,wanted,to,hear,many,particulars,of,their,engagement,repeated,again,she
wanted,more,clearly,to,understand,what,lucy,really,felt,for,edward,whether
there,were,any,sincerity,in,her,declaration,of,tender,regard,for,him
and,she,particularly,wanted,to,convince,lucy,by,her,readiness,to,enter
on,the,matter,again,and,her,calmness,in,conversing,on,it,that
she,was,no,otherwise,interested,in,it,than,as,a,friend,which
she,very,much,feared,her,involuntary,agitation,in,their,morning,discourse,must
have,left,at,leastdoubtful
that,lucy,was,disposed,to,be,jealous,of,her,appeared,very,probable
it,was,plain,that,edward,had,always,spoken,highly,in,her,praise
not,merely,from,lucy,s,assertion,but,from,her,venturing,to,trust
her,on,so,short,a,personal,acquaintance,with,a,secret,so,confessedly
and,evidentlyimportant
and,even,sir,john,s,joking,intelligence,must,have,had,someweight
but,indeed,while,elinor,remained,so,well,assured,within,herself,of,being
really,beloved,by,edward,it,required,no,other,consideration,of,probabilities,to
make,it,natural,that,lucy,should,be,jealous,and,that,she,was
so,her,very,confidence,was,aproof
what,other,reason,for,the,disclosure,of,the,affair,could,there,be
but,that,elinor,might,be,informed,by,it,of,lucy,s,superior
claims,on,edward,and,be,taught,to,avoid,him,infuture
she,had,little,difficulty,in,understanding,thus,much,of,her,rival,s
intentions,and,while,she,was,firmly,resolved,to,act,by,her,as
every,principle,of,honour,and,honesty,directed,to,combat,her,own,affection
for,edward,and,to,see,him,as,little,as,possible,she,could
not,deny,herself,the,comfort,of,endeavouring,to,convince,lucy,that,her
heart,wasunwounded
and,as,she,could,now,have,nothing,more,painful,to,hear,on
the,subject,than,had,already,been,told,she,did,not,mistrust,her
own,ability,of,going,through,a,repetition,of,particulars,withcomposure
but,it,was,not,immediately,that,an,opportunity,of,doing,so,could
be,commanded,though,lucy,was,as,well,disposed,as,herself,to,take
advantage,of,any,that,occurred,for,the,weather,was,not,often,fine
enough,to,allow,of,their,joining,in,a,walk,where,they,might
most,easily,separate,themselves,from,the,others,and,though,they,met,at
least,every,other,evening,either,at,the,park,or,cottage,and,chiefly
at,the,former,they,could,not,be,supposed,to,meet,for,the
sake,ofconversation
such,a,thought,would,never,enter,either,sir,john,or,lady,middleton
s,head,and,therefore,very,little,leisure,was,ever,given,for,a
general,chat,and,none,at,all,for,particulardiscourse
they,met,for,the,sake,of,eating,drinking,and,laughing,together,playing
at,cards,or,consequences,or,any,other,game,that,was,sufficientlynoisy
one,or,two,meetings,of,this,kind,had,taken,place,without,affording
elinor,any,chance,of,engaging,lucy,in,private,when,sir,john,called
at,the,cottage,one,morning,to,beg,in,the,name,of,charity
that,they,would,all,dine,with,lady,middleton,that,day,as,he
was,obliged,to,attend,the,club,at,exeter,and,she,would,otherwise
be,quite,alone,except,her,mother,and,the,two,misssteeles
elinor,who,foresaw,a,fairer,opening,for,the,point,she,had,in
view,in,such,a,party,as,this,was,likely,to,be,more
at,liberty,among,themselves,under,the,tranquil,and,well,bred,direction,of
lady,middleton,than,when,her,husband,united,them,together,in,one,noisy
purpose,immediately,accepted,the,invitation,margaret,with,her,mother,s,permission,was
equally,compliant,and,marianne,though,always,unwilling,to,join,any,of,their
parties,was,persuaded,by,her,mother,who,could,not,bear,to,have
her,seclude,herself,from,any,chance,of,amusement,to,golikewise
the,young,ladies,went,and,lady,middleton,was,happily,preserved,from,the
frightful,solitude,which,had,threatenedher
the,insipidity,of,the,meeting,was,exactly,such,as,elinor,had,expected
it,produced,not,one,novelty,of,thought,or,expression,and,nothing,could
be,less,interesting,than,the,whole,of,their,discourse,both,in,the
dining,parlour,and,drawing,room,to,the,latter,the,children,accompanied,them
and,while,they,remained,there,she,was,too,well,convinced,of,the
impossibility,of,engaging,lucy,s,attention,to,attemptit
they,quitted,it,only,with,the,removal,of,the,teathings
the,card,table,was,then,placed,and,elinor,began,to,wonder,at
herself,for,having,ever,entertained,a,hope,of,finding,time,for,conversation
at,thepark
they,all,rose,up,in,preparation,for,a,roundgame
i,am,glad,said,lady,middleton,to,lucy,you,are,not,going
to,finish,poor,little,annamaria,s,basket,this,evening,for,i,am
sure,it,must,hurt,your,eyes,to,work,filigree,bycandlelight
and,we,will,make,the,dear,little,love,some,amends,for,her
disappointment,to,morrow,and,then,i,hope,she,will,not,much,mind
it
this,hint,was,enough,lucy,recollected,herself,instantly,and,replied,indeed,you
are,very,much,mistaken,lady,middleton,i,am,only,waiting,to,know
whether,you,can,make,your,party,without,me,or,i,should,have
been,at,my,filigreealready
i,would,not,disappoint,the,little,angel,for,all,the,world,and
if,you,want,me,at,the,card,table,now,i,am,resolved
to,finish,the,basket,aftersupper
you,are,very,good,i,hope,it,won,t,hurt,your,eyes
will,you,ring,the,bell,for,some,workingcandles
my,poor,little,girl,would,be,sadly,disappointed,i,know,if,the
basket,was,not,finished,tomorrow,for,though,i,told,her,it,certainly
would,not,i,am,sure,she,depends,upon,having,itdone
lucy,directly,drew,her,work,table,near,her,and,reseated,herself,with
an,alacrity,and,cheerfulness,which,seemed,to,infer,that,she,could,taste
no,greater,delight,than,in,making,a,filigree,basket,for,a,spoilt
child
lady,middleton,proposed,a,rubber,of,casino,to,theothers
no,one,made,any,objection,but,marianne,who,with,her,usual,inattention
to,the,forms,of,general,civility,exclaimed,your,ladyship,will,have,the
goodness,to,excuse,_me_,you,know,i,detestcards
i,shall,go,to,the,piano,forte,i,have,not,touched,it
since,it,wastuned
and,without,farther,ceremony,she,turned,away,and,walked,to,theinstrument
lady,middleton,looked,as,if,she,thanked,heaven,that,_she_,had,never
made,so,rude,aspeech
marianne,can,never,keep,long,from,that,instrument,you,know,ma,am
said,elinor,endeavouring,to,smooth,away,the,offence,and,i,do,not

be,of,some,use,to,miss,lucy,steele,in,rolling,her,papers
for,her,and,there,is,so,much,still,to,be,done,to
the,basket,that,it,must,be,impossible,i,think,for,her,labour
singly,to,finish,it,thisevening
i,should,like,the,work,exceedingly,if,she,would,allow,me,a
share,init
indeed,i,shall,be,very,much,obliged,to,you,for,your,help
cried,lucy,for,i,find,there,is,more,to,be,done,to
it,than,i,thought,there,was,and,it,would,be,a,shocking
thing,to,disappoint,dear,annamaria,afterall
oh
that,would,be,terrible,indeed,said,misssteele
dear,little,soul,how,i,do,loveher
you,are,very,kind,said,lady,middleton,to,elinor,and,as,you
really,like,the,work,perhaps,you,will,be,as,well,pleased,not
to,cut,in,till,another,rubber,or,will,you,take,your,chance
now
elinor,joyfully,profited,by,the,first,of,these,proposals,and,thus,by
a,little,of,that,address,which,marianne,could,never,condescend,to,practise
gained,her,own,end,and,pleased,lady,middleton,at,the,sametime
lucy,made,room,for,her,with,ready,attention,and,the,two,fair
rivals,were,thus,seated,side,by,side,at,the,same,table,and
with,the,utmost,harmony,engaged,in,forwarding,the,samework
the,pianoforte,at,which,marianne,wrapped,up,in,her,own,music,and
her,own,thoughts,had,by,this,time,forgotten,that,any,body,was
in,the,room,besides,herself,was,luckily,so,near,them,that,miss

and,yet,i,do,assure,you,replied,lucy,her,little,sharp,eyes

quarrelling,with,myself,ever,since,for,having,took,such,a,liberty,as

to,the,test,by,our,long,very,long,absence,since,we,were
first,engaged,and,it,has,stood,the,trial,so,well,that,i
should,be,unpardonable,to,doubt,itnow

our,different,situations,in,life,from,his,being,so,much,more,in

for,suspicion,to,have,found,out,the,truth,in,an,instant,if
there,had,been,the,slightest,alteration,in,his,behaviour,to,me,when
we,met,or,any,lowness,of,spirits,that,i,could,not,account

death,which,is,a,melancholy,and,shocking,extremity,is,her,son,determined
to,submit,to,this,and,to,all,the,tediousness,of,the,many
years,of,suspense,in,which,it,may,involve,you,rather,than,run
the,risk,of,her,displeasure,for,a,while,by,owning,thetruth
if,we,could,be,certain,that,it,would,be,only,for,a
while
but,mrs,ferrars,is,a,very,headstrong,proud,woman,and,in,her
first,fit,of,anger,upon,hearing,it,would,very,likely,secure,every

lucy,bit,her,lip,and,looked,angrily,at,hersister
a,mutual,silence,took,place,for,sometime
lucy,first,put,an,end,to,it,by,saying,in,a,lower
tone,though,marianne,was,then,giving,them,the,powerful,protection,of,a
very,magnificent,concerto,i,will,honestly,tell,you,of,one,scheme,which

i,dare,say,you,have,seen,enough,of,edward,to,know,that
he,would,prefer,the,church,to,every,other,profession,now,my,plan
is,that,he,should,take,orders,as,soon,as,he,can,and
then,through,your,interest,which,i,am,sure,you,would,be,kind
enough,to,use,out,of,friendship,for,him,and,i,hope,out
of,some,regard,to,me,your,brother,might,be,persuaded,to,give
him,norland,living,which,i,understand,is,a,very,good,one,and

my,esteem,and,friendship,for,mr,ferrars,but,do,you,not,perceive
that,my,interest,on,such,an,occasion,would,be,perfectlyunnecessary
he,is,brother,to,mrs,john,dashwood,_that_,must,be,recommendation,enough
to,herhusband
but,mrs,john,dashwood,would,not,much,approve,of,edward,s,going
intoorders
then,i,rather,suspect,that,my,interest,would,do,verylittle
they,were,again,silent,for,manyminutes
at,length,lucy,exclaimed,with,a,deep,sigh,i,believe,it,would
be,the,wisest,way,to,put,an,end,to,the,business,at

we,seem,so,beset,with,difficulties,on,every,side,that,though,it
would,make,us,miserable,for,a,time,we,should,be,happier,perhaps
in,theend

if,you,could,be,supposed,to,be,biased,in,any,respect,by

for,me,i,have,not,spirits,forit
elinor,was,soon,called,to,the,card,table,by,the,conclusion,of
the,first,rubber,and,the,confidential,discourse,of,the,two,ladies,was
therefore,at,an,end,to,which,both,of,them,submitted,without,any
reluctance,for,nothing,had,been,said,on,either,side,to,make,them
dislike,each,other,less,than,they,had,done,before,and,elinor,sat
down,to,the,card,table,with,the,melancholy,persuasion,that,edward,was
not,only,without,affection,for,the,person,who,was,to,be,his
wife,but,that,he,had,not,even,the,chance,of,being,tolerably
happy,in,marriage,which,sincere,affection,on,_her_,side,would,have,given
for,self,interest,alone,could,induce,a,woman,to,keep,a,man
to,an,engagement,of,which,she,seemed,so,thoroughly,aware,that,he
wasweary
from,this,time,the,subject,was,never,revived,by,elinor,and,when
entered,on,by,lucy,who,seldom,missed,an,opportunity,of,introducing,it
and,was,particularly,careful,to,inform,her,confidante,of,her,happiness,whenever
she,received,a,letter,from,edward,it,was,treated,by,the,former
with,calmness,and,caution,and,dismissed,as,soon,as,civility,would,allow
for,she,felt,such,conversations,to,be,an,indulgence,which,lucy,did
not,deserve,and,which,were,dangerous,toherself
the,visit,of,the,miss,steeles,at,barton,park,was,lengthened,far
beyond,what,the,first,invitationimplied
their,favour,increased,they,could,not,be,spared,sir,john,would,not
hear,of,their,going,and,in,spite,of,their,numerous,and,long
arranged,engagements,in,exeter,in,spite,of,the,absolute,necessity,of,returning
to,fulfill,them,immediately,which,was,in,full,force,at,the,end
of,every,week,they,were,prevailed,on,to,stay,nearly,two,months
at,the,park,and,to,assist,in,the,due,celebration,of,that
festival,which,requires,a,more,than,ordinary,share,of,private,balls,and
large,dinners,to,proclaim,itsimportance
chapter,xxv,though,mrs,jennings,was,in,the,habit,of,spending,a
large,portion,of,the,year,at,the,houses,of,her,children,and
friends,she,was,not,without,a,settled,habitation,of,herown
since,the,death,of,her,husband,who,had,traded,with,success,in
a,less,elegant,part,of,the,town,she,had,resided,every,winter
in,a,house,in,one,of,the,streets,near,portmansquare
towards,this,home,she,began,on,the,approach,of,january,to,turn
her,thoughts,and,thither,she,one,day,abruptly,and,very,unexpectedly,by
them,asked,the,elder,misses,dashwood,to,accompanyher
elinor,without,observing,the,varying,complexion,of,her,sister,and,the,animated
look,which,spoke,no,indifference,to,the,plan,immediately,gave,a,grateful
but,absolute,denial,for,both,in,which,she,believed,herself,to,be
speaking,their,unitedinclinations
the,reason,alleged,was,their,determined,resolution,of,not,leaving,their,mother
at,that,time,of,theyear
mrs,jennings,received,the,refusal,with,some,surprise,and,repeated,her,invitation
immediately
ohlord
i,am,sure,your,mother,can,spare,you,very,well,and,i
_do_,beg,you,will,favour,me,with,your,company,for,i,ve
quite,set,my,heart,uponit
don,t,fancy,that,you,will,be,any,inconvenience,to,me,for

it,will,only,be,sending,betty,by,the,coach,and,i,hope
i,can,afford,_that,_,we,three,shall,be,able,to,go
very,well,in,my,chaise,and,when,we,are,in,town,if
you,do,not,like,to,go,wherever,i,do,well,and,good
you,may,always,go,with,one,of,mydaughters
i,am,sure,your,mother,will,not,object,to,it,for,i
have,had,such,good,luck,in,getting,my,own,children,off,my
hands,that,she,will,think,me,a,very,fit,person,to,have
the,charge,of,you,and,if,i,don,t,get,one,of
you,at,least,well,married,before,i,have,done,with,you,it
shall,not,be,myfault
i,shall,speak,a,good,word,for,you,to,all,the,young
men,you,may,depend,uponit
i,have,a,notion,said,sir,john,that,miss,marianne,would,not
object,to,such,a,scheme,if,her,elder,sister,would,come,into
it
it,is,very,hard,indeed,that,she,should,not,have,a,little
pleasure,because,miss,dashwood,does,not,wishit
so,i,would,advise,you,two,to,set,off,for,town,when
you,are,tired,of,barton,without,saying,a,word,to,miss,dashwood
aboutit
nay,cried,mrs,jennings,i,am,sure,i,shall,be,monstrous,glad
of,miss,marianne,s,company,whether,miss,dashwood,will,go,or,not
only,the,more,the,merrier,say,i,and,i,thought,it,would
be,more,comfortable,for,them,to,be,together,because,if,they,got
tired,of,me,they,might,talk,to,one,another,and,laugh,at
my,old,ways,behind,myback
but,one,or,the,other,if,not,both,of,them,i,must
have
lord,blessme
how,do,you,think,i,can,live,poking,by,myself,i,who
have,been,always,used,till,this,winter,to,have,charlotte,withme
come,miss,marianne,let,us,strike,hands,upon,the,bargain,and,if
miss,dashwood,will,change,her,mind,by,and,bye,why,so,much
thebetter
i,thank,you,ma,am,sincerely,thank,you,said,marianne,with,warmth
your,invitation,has,insured,my,gratitude,for,ever,and,it,would,give
me,such,happiness,yes,almost,the,greatest,happiness,i,am,capable,of
to,be,able,to,acceptit
but,my,mother,my,dearest,kindest,mother,i,feel,the,justice,of
what,elinor,has,urged,and,if,she,were,to,be,made,less
happy,less,comfortable,by,our,absenceoh
no,nothing,should,tempt,me,to,leaveher
it,should,not,must,not,be,astruggle
mrs,jennings,repeated,her,assurance,that,mrs,dashwood,could,spare,them,perfectly
well,and,elinor,who,now,understood,her,sister,and,saw,to,what
indifference,to,almost,every,thing,else,she,was,carried,by,her,eagerness
to,be,with,willoughby,again,made,no,farther,direct,opposition,to,the
plan,and,merely,referred,it,to,her,mother,s,decision,from,whom
however,she,scarcely,expected,to,receive,any,support,in,her,endeavour,to
prevent,a,visit,which,she,could,not,approve,of,for,marianne,and
which,on,her,own,account,she,had,particular,reasons,toavoid
whatever,marianne,was,desirous,of,her,mother,would,be,eager,to,promote
she,could,not,expect,to,influence,the,latter,to,cautiousness,of,conduct
in,an,affair,respecting,which,she,had,never,been,able,to,inspire
her,with,distrust,and,she,dared,not,explain,the,motive,of,her
own,disinclination,for,going,tolondon
that,marianne,fastidious,as,she,was,thoroughly,acquainted,with,mrs,jennings,manners
and,invariably,disgusted,by,them,should,overlook,every,inconvenience,of,that,kind
should,disregard,whatever,must,be,most,wounding,to,her,irritable,feelings,in
her,pursuit,of,one,object,was,such,a,proof,so,strong,so
full,of,the,importance,of,that,object,to,her,as,elinor,in
spite,of,all,that,had,passed,was,not,prepared,towitness
on,being,informed,of,the,invitation,mrs,dashwood,persuaded,that,such,an
excursion,would,be,productive,of,much,amusement,to,both,her,daughters,and
perceiving,through,all,her,affectionate,attention,to,herself,how,much,the,heart
of,marianne,was,in,it,would,not,hear,of,their,declining,the
offer,upon,_her_,account,insisted,on,their,both,accepting,it,directly,and
then,began,to,foresee,with,her,usual,cheerfulness,a,variety,of,advantages
that,would,accrue,to,them,all,from,thisseparation
i,am,delighted,with,the,plan,she,cried,it,is,exactly,what
i,couldwish
margaret,and,i,shall,be,as,much,benefited,by,it,asyourselves
when,you,and,the,middletons,are,gone,we,shall,go,on,so
quietly,and,happily,together,with,our,books,and,ourmusic
you,will,find,margaret,so,improved,when,you,come,backagain
i,have,a,little,plan,of,alteration,for,your,bedrooms,too,which
may,now,be,performed,without,any,inconvenience,to,anyone
it,is,very,right,that,you,_should_,go,to,town,i,would
have,every,young,woman,of,your,condition,in,life,acquainted,with,the
manners,and,amusements,oflondon
you,will,be,under,the,care,of,a,motherly,good,sort,of
woman,of,whose,kindness,to,you,i,can,have,nodoubt
and,in,all,probability,you,will,see,your,brother,and,whatever,may
be,his,faults,or,the,faults,of,his,wife,when,i,consider
whose,son,he,is,i,cannot,bear,to,have,you,so,wholly
estranged,from,eachother
though,with,your,usual,anxiety,for,our,happiness,said,elinor,you,have
been,obviating,every,impediment,to,the,present,scheme,which,occurred,to,you
there,is,still,one,objection,which,in,my,opinion,cannot,be,so
easilyremoved
marianne,s,countenancesunk
and,what,said,mrs,dashwood,is,my,dear,prudent,elinor,going,to
suggest
what,formidable,obstacle,is,she,now,to,bringforward
do,let,me,hear,a,word,about,the,expense,ofit
my,objection,is,this,though,i,think,very,well,of,mrs,jennings
s,heart,she,is,not,a,woman,whose,society,can,afford,us
pleasure,or,whose,protection,will,give,usconsequence
that,is,very,true,replied,her,mother,but,of,her,society,separately
from,that,of,other,people,you,will,scarcely,have,any,thing,at
all,and,you,will,almost,always,appear,in,public,with,ladymiddleton
if,elinor,is,frightened,away,by,her,dislike,of,mrs,jennings,said
marianne,at,least,it,need,not,prevent,_my_,accepting,herinvitation
i,have,no,such,scruples,and,i,am,sure,i,could,put
up,with,every,unpleasantness,of,that,kind,with,very,littleeffort
elinor,could,not,help,smiling,at,this,display,of,indifference,towards,the
manners,of,a,person,to,whom,she,had,often,had,difficulty,in
persuading,marianne,to,behave,with,tolerable,politeness,and,resolved,within,herself,that
if,her,sister,persisted,in,going,she,would,go,likewise,as,she
did,not,think,it,proper,that,marianne,should,be,left,to,the
sole,guidance,of,her,own,judgment,or,that,mrs,jennings,should,be
abandoned,to,the,mercy,of,marianne,for,all,the,comfort,of,her
domestichours
to,this,determination,she,was,the,more,easily,reconciled,by,recollecting,that
edward,ferrars,by,lucy,s,account,was,not,to,be,in,town
before,february,and,that,their,visit,without,any,unreasonable,abridgement,might,be
previouslyfinished
i,will,have,you,_both_,go,said,mrs,dashwood,these,objections,are
nonsensical
you,will,have,much,pleasure,in,being,in,london,and,especially,in
being,together,and,if,elinor,would,ever,condescend,to,anticipate,enjoyment,she
would,foresee,it,there,from,a,variety,of,sources,she,would,perhaps
expect,some,from,improving,her,acquaintance,with,her,sister,in,law,s
family
elinor,had,often,wished,for,an,opportunity,of,attempting,to,weaken,her
mother,s,dependence,on,the,attachment,of,edward,and,herself,that,the
shock,might,be,less,when,the,whole,truth,were,revealed,and,now
on,this,attack,though,almost,hopeless,of,success,she,forced,herself,to
begin,her,design,by,saying,as,calmly,as,she,could,i,like
edward,ferrars,very,much,and,shall,always,be,glad,to,see,him
but,as,to,the,rest,of,the,family,it,is,a,matter
of,perfect,indifference,to,me,whether,i,am,ever,known,to,them
ornot
mrs,dashwood,smiled,and,saidnothing
marianne,lifted,up,her,eyes,in,astonishment,and,elinor,conjectured,that,she
might,as,well,have,held,hertongue
after,very,little,farther,discourse,it,was,finally,settled,that,the,invitation
should,be,fullyaccepted
mrs,jennings,received,the,information,with,a,great,deal,of,joy,and
many,assurances,of,kindness,and,care,nor,was,it,a,matter,of
pleasure,merely,toher
sir,john,was,delighted,for,to,a,man,whose,prevailing,anxiety,was
the,dread,of,being,alone,the,acquisition,of,two,to,the,number
of,inhabitants,in,london,wassomething
even,lady,middleton,took,the,trouble,of,being,delighted,which,was,putting
herself,rather,out,of,her,way,and,as,for,the,miss,steeles
especially,lucy,they,had,never,been,so,happy,in,their,lives,as
this,intelligence,madethem
elinor,submitted,to,the,arrangement,which,counteracted,her,wishes,with,less,reluctance
than,she,had,expected,tofeel
with,regard,to,herself,it,was,now,a,matter,of,unconcern,whether
she,went,to,town,or,not,and,when,she,saw,her,mother
so,thoroughly,pleased,with,the,plan,and,her,sister,exhilarated,by,it
in,look,voice,and,manner,restored,to,all,her,usual,animation,and
elevated,to,more,than,her,usual,gaiety,she,could,not,be,dissatisfied
with,the,cause,and,would,hardly,allow,herself,to,distrust,theconsequence
marianne,s,joy,was,almost,a,degree,beyond,happiness,so,great,was
the,perturbation,of,her,spirits,and,her,impatience,to,begone
her,unwillingness,to,quit,her,mother,was,her,only,restorative,to,calmness
and,at,the,moment,of,parting,her,grief,on,that,score,was
excessive
her,mother,s,affliction,was,hardly,less,and,elinor,was,the,only
one,of,the,three,who,seemed,to,consider,the,separation,as,any
thing,short,ofeternal
their,departure,took,place,in,the,first,week,injanuary
the,middletons,were,to,follow,in,about,aweek
the,miss,steeles,kept,their,station,at,the,park,and,were,to
quit,it,only,with,the,rest,of,thefamily
chapter,xxvi,elinor,could,not,find,herself,in,the,carriage,with,mrs
jennings,and,beginning,a,journey,to,london,under,her,protection,and,as
her,guest,without,wondering,at,her,own,situation,so,short,had,their
acquaintance,with,that,lady,been,so,wholly,unsuited,were,they,in,age
and,disposition,and,so,many,had,been,her,objections,against,such,a
measure,only,a,few,daysbefore
but,these,objections,had,all,with,that,happy,ardour,of,youth,which
marianne,and,her,mother,equally,shared,been,overcome,or,overlooked,and,elinor
in,spite,of,every,occasional,doubt,of,willoughby,s,constancy,could,not
witness,the,rapture,of,delightful,expectation,which,filled,the,whole,soul,and
beamed,in,the,eyes,of,marianne,without,feeling,how,blank,was,her
own,prospect,how,cheerless,her,own,state,of,mind,in,the,comparison
and,how,gladly,she,would,engage,in,the,solicitude,of,marianne,s
situation,to,have,the,same,animating,object,in,view,the,same,possibility
ofhope
a,short,a,very,short,time,however,must,now,decide,what,willoughby
s,intentions,were,in,all,probability,he,was,already,intown
marianne,s,eagerness,to,be,gone,declared,her,dependence,on,finding,him
there,and,elinor,was,resolved,not,only,upon,gaining,every,new,light
as,to,his,character,which,her,own,observation,or,the,intelligence,of
others,could,give,her,but,likewise,upon,watching,his,behaviour,to,her
sister,with,such,zealous,attention,as,to,ascertain,what,he,was,and
what,he,meant,before,many,meetings,had,takenplace
should,the,result,of,her,observations,be,unfavourable,she,was,determined,at
all,events,to,open,the,eyes,of,her,sister,should,it,be
otherwise,her,exertions,would,be,of,a,different,nature,she,must,then
learn,to,avoid,every,selfish,comparison,and,banish,every,regret,which,might
lessen,her,satisfaction,in,the,happiness,ofmarianne
they,were,three,days,on,their,journey,and,marianne,s,behaviour,as
they,travelled,was,a,happy,specimen,of,what,future,complaisance,and,companionableness
to,mrs,jennings,might,be,expected,tobe
she,sat,in,silence,almost,all,the,way,wrapt,in,her,own
meditations,and,scarcely,ever,voluntarily,speaking,except,when,any,object,of,picturesque
beauty,within,their,view,drew,from,her,an,exclamation,of,delight,exclusively
addressed,to,hersister
to,atone,for,this,conduct,therefore,elinor,took,immediate,possession,of,the
post,of,civility,which,she,had,assigned,herself,behaved,with,the,greatest
attention,to,mrs,jennings,talked,with,her,laughed,with,her,and,listened
to,her,whenever,she,could,and,mrs,jennings,on,her,side,treated
them,both,with,all,possible,kindness,was,solicitous,on,every,occasion,for
their,ease,and,enjoyment,and,only,disturbed,that,she,could,not,make
them,choose,their,own,dinners,at,the,inn,nor,extort,a,confession
of,their,preferring,salmon,to,cod,or,boiled,fowls,to,vealcutlets
they,reached,town,by,three,o,clock,the,third,day,glad,to
be,released,after,such,a,journey,from,the,confinement,of,a,carriage
and,ready,to,enjoy,all,the,luxury,of,a,goodfire
the,house,was,handsome,and,handsomely,fitted,up,and,the,young,ladies
were,immediately,put,in,possession,of,a,very,comfortableapartment
it,had,formerly,been,charlotte,s,and,over,the,mantelpiece,still,hung
a,landscape,in,coloured,silks,of,her,performance,in,proof,of,her
having,spent,seven,years,at,a,great,school,in,town,to,some
effect
as,dinner,was,not,to,be,ready,in,less,than,two,hours
from,their,arrival,elinor,determined,to,employ,the,interval,in,writing,to
her,mother,and,sat,down,for,thatpurpose
in,a,few,moments,marianne,did,thesame
i,am,writing,home,marianne,said,elinor,had,not,you,better,defer
your,letter,for,a,day,ortwo
i,am,_not_,going,to,write,to,my,mother,replied,marianne,hastily
and,as,if,wishing,to,avoid,any,fartherinquiry
elinor,said,no,more,it,immediately,struck,her,that,she,must,then
be,writing,to,willoughby,and,the,conclusion,which,as,instantly,followed,was
that,however,mysteriously,they,might,wish,to,conduct,the,affair,they,must
beengaged
this,conviction,though,not,entirely,satisfactory,gave,her,pleasure,and,she,continued
her,letter,with,greateralacrity
marianne,s,was,finished,in,a,very,few,minutes,in,length,it
could,be,no,more,than,a,note,it,was,then,folded,up
sealed,and,directed,with,eagerrapidity
elinor,thought,she,could,distinguish,a,large,w,in,the,direction,and
no,sooner,was,it,complete,than,marianne,ringing,the,bell,requested,the
footman,who,answered,it,to,get,that,letter,conveyed,for,her,to
the,two,pennypost
this,decided,the,matter,atonce
her,spirits,still,continued,very,high,but,there,was,a,flutter,in
them,which,prevented,their,giving,much,pleasure,to,her,sister,and,this
agitation,increased,as,the,evening,drewon
she,could,scarcely,eat,any,dinner,and,when,they,afterwards,returned,to
the,drawing,room,seemed,anxiously,listening,to,the,sound,of,everycarriage
it,was,a,great,satisfaction,to,elinor,that,mrs,jennings,by,being
much,engaged,in,her,own,room,could,see,little,of,what,was
passing
the,tea,things,were,brought,in,and,already,had,marianne,been,disappointed
more,than,once,by,a,rap,at,a,neighbouring,door,when,a
loud,one,was,suddenly,heard,which,could,not,be,mistaken,for,one
at,any,other,house,elinor,felt,secure,of,its,announcing,willoughby,s
approach,and,marianne,starting,up,moved,towards,thedoor
every,thing,was,silent,this,could,not,be,borne,many,seconds,she
opened,the,door,advanced,a,few,steps,towards,the,stairs,and,after
listening,half,a,minute,returned,into,the,room,in,all,the,agitation
which,a,conviction,of,having,heard,him,would,naturally,produce,in,the
ecstasy,of,her,feelings,at,that,instant,she,could,not,help,exclaiming
oh,elinor,it,is,willoughby,indeed,itis
and,seemed,almost,ready,to,throw,herself,into,his,arms,when,colonel
brandonappeared
it,was,too,great,a,shock,to,be,borne,with,calmness,and
she,immediately,left,theroom
elinor,was,disappointed,too,but,at,the,same,time,her,regard,for
colonel,brandon,ensured,his,welcome,with,her,and,she,felt,particularly,hurt
that,a,man,so,partial,to,her,sister,should,perceive,that,she
experienced,nothing,but,grief,and,disappointment,in,seeinghim
she,instantly,saw,that,it,was,not,unnoticed,by,him,that,he
even,observed,marianne,as,she,quitted,the,room,with,such,astonishment,and
concern,as,hardly,left,him,the,recollection,of,what,civility,demanded,towards
herself
is,your,sisterill
saidhe
elinor,answered,in,some,distress,that,she,was,and,then,talked,of
head,aches,low,spirits,and,over,fatigues,and,of,every,thing,to
which,she,could,decently,attribute,her,sister,sbehaviour
he,heard,her,with,the,most,earnest,attention,but,seeming,to,recollect
himself,said,no,more,on,the,subject,and,began,directly,to,speak
of,his,pleasure,at,seeing,them,in,london,making,the,usual,inquiries
about,their,journey,and,the,friends,they,had,leftbehind
in,this,calm,kind,of,way,with,very,little,interest,on,either
side,they,continued,to,talk,both,of,them,out,of,spirits,and
the,thoughts,of,both,engagedelsewhere
elinor,wished,very,much,to,ask,whether,willoughby,were,then,in,town
but,she,was,afraid,of,giving,him,pain,by,any,enquiry,after
his,rival,and,at,length,by,way,of,saying,something,she,asked
if,he,had,been,in,london,ever,since,she,had,seen,him
last
yes,he,replied,with,some,embarrassment,almost,ever,since,i,have,been
once,or,twice,at,delaford,for,a,few,days,but,it,has
never,been,in,my,power,to,return,tobarton
this,and,the,manner,in,which,it,was,said,immediately,brought,back
to,her,remembrance,all,the,circumstances,of,his,quitting,that,place,with
the,uneasiness,and,suspicions,they,had,caused,to,mrs,jennings,and,she
was,fearful,that,her,question,had,implied,much,more,curiosity,on,the
subject,than,she,had,everfelt
mrs,jennings,soon,camein
oh
colonel,said,she,with,her,usual,noisy,cheerfulness,i,am,monstrous,glad

but,colonel,where,have,you,been,to,since,weparted
and,how,does,your,business,goon
come,come,let,s,have,no,secrets,amongfriends
he,replied,with,his,accustomary,mildness,to,all,her,inquiries,but,without
satisfying,her,inany
elinor,now,began,to,make,the,tea,and,marianne,was,obliged,to
appearagain
after,her,entrance,colonel,brandon,became,more,thoughtful,and,silent,than,he
had,been,before,and,mrs,jennings,could,not,prevail,on,him,to
staylong
no,other,visitor,appeared,that,evening,and,the,ladies,were,unanimous,in
agreeing,to,go,early,tobed
marianne,rose,the,next,morning,with,recovered,spirits,and,happylooks
the,disappointment,of,the,evening,before,seemed,forgotten,in,the,expectation,of
what,was,to,happen,thatday
they,had,not,long,finished,their,breakfast,before,mrs,palmer,s,barouche
stopped,at,the,door,and,in,a,few,minutes,she,came,laughing
into,the,room,so,delighted,to,see,them,all,that,it,was
hard,to,say,whether,she,received,most,pleasure,from,meeting,her,mother
or,the,miss,dashwoodsagain
so,surprised,at,their,coming,to,town,though,it,was,what,she
had,rather,expected,all,along,so,angry,at,their,accepting,her,mother
s,invitation,after,having,declined,her,own,though,at,the,same,time
she,would,never,have,forgiven,them,if,they,had,notcome
mr,palmer,will,be,so,happy,to,see,you,said,she,what
do,you,think,he,said,when,he,heard,of,your,coming,with
mamma
i,forget,what,it,was,now,but,it,was,something,sodroll
after,an,hour,or,two,spent,in,what,her,mother,called,comfortable
chat,or,in,other,words,in,every,variety,of,inquiry,concerning,all
their,acquaintance,on,mrs,jennings,s,side,and,in,laughter,without,cause
on,mrs,palmer,s,it,was,proposed,by,the,latter,that,they
should,all,accompany,her,to,some,shops,where,she,had,business,that
morning,to,which,mrs,jennings,and,elinor,readily,consented,as,having,likewise
some,purchases,to,make,themselves,and,marianne,though,declining,it,at,first
was,induced,to,golikewise
wherever,they,went,she,was,evidently,always,on,thewatch
in,bond,street,especially,where,much,of,their,business,lay,her,eyes
were,in,constant,inquiry,and,in,whatever,shop,the,party,were,engaged
her,mind,was,equally,abstracted,from,every,thing,actually,before,them,from
all,that,interested,and,occupied,theothers
restless,and,dissatisfied,every,where,her,sister,could,never,obtain,her,opinion
of,any,article,of,purchase,however,it,might,equally,concern,them,both
she,received,no,pleasure,from,anything,was,only,impatient,to,be,at
home,again,and,could,with,difficulty,govern,her,vexation,at,the,tediousness
of,mrs,palmer,whose,eye,was,caught,by,every,thing,pretty,expensive
or,new,who,was,wild,to,buy,all,could,determine,on,none
and,dawdled,away,her,time,in,rapture,andindecision
it,was,late,in,the,morning,before,they,returned,home,and,no
sooner,had,they,entered,the,house,than,marianne,flew,eagerly,up,stairs
and,when,elinor,followed,she,found,her,turning,from,the,table,with
a,sorrowful,countenance,which,declared,that,no,willoughby,had,beenthere
has,no,letter,been,left,here,for,me,since,we,wentout
said,she,to,the,footman,who,then,entered,with,theparcels
she,was,answered,in,thenegative

to,thewindow
how,oddindeed
repeated,elinor,within,herself,regarding,her,sister,withuneasiness
if,she,had,not,known,him,to,be,in,town,she,would
not,have,written,to,him,as,she,did,she,would,have,written
to,combe,magna,and,if,he,is,in,town,how,odd,that

oh
my,dear,mother,you,must,be,wrong,in,permitting,an,engagement,between

on,in,so,doubtful,so,mysterious,amanner
i,long,to,inquire,and,how,will,_my_,interference,beborne
she,determined,after,some,consideration,that,if,appearances,continued,many,days,longer
as,unpleasant,as,they,now,were,she,would,represent,in,the,strongest
manner,to,her,mother,the,necessity,of,some,serious,enquiry,into,the
affair
mrs,palmer,and,two,elderly,ladies,of,mrs,jennings,s,intimate,acquaintance
whom,she,had,met,and,invited,in,the,morning,dined,withthem
the,former,left,them,soon,after,tea,to,fulfill,her,evening,engagements
and,elinor,was,obliged,to,assist,in,making,a,whist,table,for
theothers
marianne,was,of,no,use,on,these,occasions,as,she,would,never
learn,the,game,but,though,her,time,was,therefore,at,her,own
disposal,the,evening,was,by,no,means,more,productive,of,pleasure,to
her,than,to,elinor,for,it,was,spent,in,all,the,anxiety
of,expectation,and,the,pain,ofdisappointment
she,sometimes,endeavoured,for,a,few,minutes,to,read,but,the,book
was,soon,thrown,aside,and,she,returned,to,the,more,interesting,employment
of,walking,backwards,and,forwards,across,the,room,pausing,for,a,moment
whenever,she,came,to,the,window,in,hopes,of,distinguishing,the,long
expectedrap

that,is,true,cried,marianne,in,a,cheerful,voice,and,walking,to
the,window,as,she,spoke,to,examine,theday
i,had,not,thought,ofthat
this,weather,will,keep,many,sportsmen,in,thecountry
it,was,a,lucky,recollection,all,her,good,spirits,were,restored,by
it
it,is,charming,weather,for,_them_,indeed,she,continued,as,she,sat
down,to,the,breakfast,table,with,a,happycountenance
how,much,they,must,enjoyit
but,with,a,little,return,of,anxiety,it,cannot,be,expected,to

end,of,nextweek
ay,my,dear,i,ll,warrant,you,wedo
mary,always,has,her,ownway
and,now,silently,conjectured,elinor,she,will,write,to,combe,by,this
day,spost
but,if,she,_did_,the,letter,was,written,and,sent,away,with
a,privacy,which,eluded,all,her,watchfulness,to,ascertain,thefact
whatever,the,truth,of,it,might,be,and,far,as,elinor,was
from,feeling,thorough,contentment,about,it,yet,while,she,saw,marianne,in
spirits,she,could,not,be,very,uncomfortableherself
and,marianne,was,in,spirits,happy,in,the,mildness,of,the,weather
and,still,happier,in,her,expectation,of,afrost
the,morning,was,chiefly,spent,in,leaving,cards,at,the,houses,of
mrs,jennings,s,acquaintance,to,inform,them,of,her,being,in,town
and,marianne,was,all,the,time,busy,in,observing,the,direction,of
the,wind,watching,the,variations,of,the,sky,and,imagining,an,alteration

elinor,was,alternately,diverted,and,pained,but,marianne,persevered,and,saw,every
night,in,the,brightness,of,the,fire,and,every,morning,in,the
appearance,of,the,atmosphere,the,certain,symptoms,of,approachingfrost
the,miss,dashwoods,had,no,greater,reason,to,be,dissatisfied,with,mrs
jennings,s,style,of,living,and,set,of,acquaintance,than,with,her
behaviour,to,themselves,which,was,invariablykind
every,thing,in,her,household,arrangements,was,conducted,on,the,most,liberal
plan,and,excepting,a,few,old,city,friends,whom,to,lady,middleton

had,expected,elinor,was,very,willing,to,compound,for,the,want,of
much,real,enjoyment,from,any,of,their,evening,parties,which,whether,at
home,or,abroad,formed,only,for,cards,could,have,little,to,amuse
her
colonel,brandon,who,had,a,general,invitation,to,the,house,was,with
them,almost,every,day,he,came,to,look,at,marianne,and,talk
to,elinor,who,often,derived,more,satisfaction,from,conversing,with,him,than
from,any,other,daily,occurrence,but,who,saw,at,the,same,time
with,much,concern,his,continued,regard,for,hersister
she,feared,it,was,a,strengtheningregard
it,grieved,her,to,see,the,earnestness,with,which,he,often,watched
marianne,and,his,spirits,were,certainly,worse,than,when,atbarton
about,a,week,after,their,arrival,it,became,certain,that,willoughby,was

in,persuading,her,sister,to,go,for,still,she,had,seen,nothing

in,the,country,an,unpremeditated,dance,was,very,allowable,but,in,london
where,the,reputation,of,elegance,was,more,important,and,less,easily,attained
it,was,risking,too,much,for,the,gratification,of,a,few,girls
to,have,it,known,that,lady,middleton,had,given,a,small,dance
of,eight,or,nine,couple,with,two,violins,and,a,mere,side
boardcollation
mr,and,mrs,palmer,were,of,the,party,from,the,former,whom
they,had,not,seen,before,since,their,arrival,in,town,as,he
was,careful,to,avoid,the,appearance,of,any,attention,to,his,mother
in,law,and,therefore,never,came,near,her,they,received,no,mark
of,recognition,on,theirentrance
he,looked,at,them,slightly,without,seeming,to,know,who,they,were
and,merely,nodded,to,mrs,jennings,from,the,other,side,of,the
room
marianne,gave,one,glance,round,the,apartment,as,she,entered,it,was
enough,_he_,was,not,there,and,she,sat,down,equally,ill,disposed
to,receive,or,communicatepleasure
after,they,had,been,assembled,about,an,hour,mr,palmer,sauntered,towards
the,miss,dashwoods,to,express,his,surprise,on,seeing,them,in,town
though,colonel,brandon,had,been,first,informed,of,their,arrival,at,his
house,and,he,had,himself,said,something,very,droll,on,hearing,that
they,were,tocome
i,thought,you,were,both,in,devonshire,saidhe
didyou
repliedelinor
when,do,you,go,backagain
i,do,notknow
and,thus,ended,theirdiscourse
never,had,marianne,been,so,unwilling,to,dance,in,her,life,as
she,was,that,evening,and,never,so,much,fatigued,by,theexercise
she,complained,of,it,as,they,returned,to,berkeleystreet
aye,aye,said,mrs,jennings,we,know,the,reason,of,all,that
very,well,if,a,certain,person,who,shall,be,nameless,had,been
there,you,would,not,have,been,a,bit,tired,and,to,say
the,truth,it,was,not,very,pretty,of,him,not,to,give
you,the,meeting,when,he,wasinvited
invited
criedmarianne
so,my,daughter,middleton,told,me,for,it,seems,sir,john,met
him,somewhere,in,the,street,thismorning
marianne,said,no,more,but,looked,exceedinglyhurt
impatient,in,this,situation,to,be,doing,something,that,might,lead,to
her,sister,s,relief,elinor,resolved,to,write,the,next,morning,to
her,mother,and,hoped,by,awakening,her,fears,for,the,health,of
marianne,to,procure,those,inquiries,which,had,been,so,long,delayed,and
she,was,still,more,eagerly,bent,on,this,measure,by,perceiving,after
breakfast,on,the,morrow,that,marianne,was,again,writing,to,willoughby,for
she,could,not,suppose,it,to,be,to,any,otherperson
about,the,middle,of,the,day,mrs,jennings,went,out,by,herself
on,business,and,elinor,began,her,letter,directly,while,marianne,too,restless
for,employment,too,anxious,for,conversation,walked,from,one,window,to,the
other,or,sat,down,by,the,fire,in,melancholymeditation
elinor,was,very,earnest,in,her,application,to,her,mother,relating,all
that,had,passed,her,suspicions,of,willoughby,s,inconstancy,urging,her,by
every,plea,of,duty,and,affection,to,demand,from,marianne,an,account
of,her,real,situation,with,respect,tohim
her,letter,was,scarcely,finished,when,a,rap,foretold,a,visitor,and
colonel,brandon,wasannounced
marianne,who,had,seen,him,from,the,window,and,who,hated,company
of,any,kind,left,the,room,before,he,enteredit
he,looked,more,than,usually,grave,and,though,expressing,satisfaction,at,finding
miss,dashwood,alone,as,if,he,had,somewhat,in,particular,to,tell
her,sat,for,some,time,without,saying,aword
elinor,persuaded,that,he,had,some,communication,to,make,in,which,her
sister,was,concerned,impatiently,expected,itsopening
it,was,not,the,first,time,of,her,feeling,the,same,kind
of,conviction,for,more,than,once,before,beginning,with,the,observation,of
your,sister,looks,unwell,to,day,or,your,sister,seems,out,of
spirits,he,had,appeared,on,the,point,either,of,disclosing,or,of
inquiring,something,particular,abouther
after,a,pause,of,several,minutes,their,silence,was,broken,by,his
asking,her,in,a,voice,of,some,agitation,when,he,was,to
congratulate,her,on,the,acquisition,of,abrother
elinor,was,not,prepared,for,such,a,question,and,having,no,answer
ready,was,obliged,to,adopt,the,simple,and,common,expedient,of,asking
what,hemeant
he,tried,to,smile,as,he,replied,your,sister,s,engagement,to
mr,willoughby,is,very,generallyknown
it,cannot,be,generally,known,returned,elinor,for,her,own,family,do
not,knowit
he,looked,surprised,and,said,i,beg,your,pardon,i,am,afraid
my,inquiry,has,been,impertinent,but,i,had,not,supposed,any,secrecy
intended,as,they,openly,correspond,and,their,marriage,is,universally,talkedof
how,can,thatbe
by,whom,can,you,have,heard,itmentioned
by,many,by,some,of,whom,you,know,nothing,by,others,with
whom,you,are,most,intimate,mrs,jennings,mrs,palmer,and,themiddletons
but,still,i,might,not,have,believed,it,for,where,the,mind
is,perhaps,rather,unwilling,to,be,convinced,it,will,always,find,something
to,support,its,doubts,if,i,had,not,when,the,servant,let
me,in,today,accidentally,seen,a,letter,in,his,hand,directed,to
mr,willoughby,in,your,sister,swriting
i,came,to,inquire,but,i,was,convinced,before,i,could,ask
thequestion
is,every,thing,finallysettled
is,it,impossibleto
but,i,have,no,right,and,i,could,have,no,chance,of
succeeding
excuse,me,missdashwood
i,believe,i,have,been,wrong,in,saying,so,much,but,i
hardly,know,what,to,do,and,on,your,prudence,i,have,the
strongestdependence
tell,me,that,it,is,all,absolutely,resolved,on,that,any,attempt
that,in,short,concealment,if,concealment,be,possible,is,all,thatremains
these,words,which,conveyed,to,elinor,a,direct,avowal,of,his,love
for,her,sister,affected,her,verymuch
she,was,not,immediately,able,to,say,anything,and,even,when,her
spirits,were,recovered,she,debated,for,a,short,time,on,the,answer
it,would,be,most,proper,togive
the,real,state,of,things,between,willoughby,and,her,sister,was,so
little,known,to,herself,that,in,endeavouring,to,explain,it,she,might
be,as,liable,to,say,too,much,as,toolittle
yet,as,she,was,convinced,that,marianne,s,affection,for,willoughby,could
leave,no,hope,of,colonel,brandon,s,success,whatever,the,event,of
that,affection,might,be,and,at,the,same,time,wished,to,shield
her,conduct,from,censure,she,thought,it,most,prudent,and,kind,after
some,consideration,to,say,more,than,she,really,knew,orbelieved
she,acknowledged,therefore,that,though,she,had,never,been,informed,by,themselves
of,the,terms,on,which,they,stood,with,each,other,of,their
mutual,affection,she,had,no,doubt,and,of,their,correspondence,she,was
not,astonished,tohear
he,listened,to,her,with,silent,attention,and,on,her,ceasing,to
speak,rose,directly,from,his,seat,and,after,saying,in,a,voice
of,emotion,to,your,sister,i,wish,all,imaginable,happiness,to,willoughby
that,he,may,endeavour,to,deserve,her,took,leave,and,wentaway
elinor,derived,no,comfortable,feelings,from,this,conversation,to,lessen,the,uneasiness
of,her,mind,on,other,points,she,was,left,on,the,contrary
with,a,melancholy,impression,of,colonel,brandon,s,unhappiness,and,was,prevented
even,from,wishing,it,removed,by,her,anxiety,for,the,very,event
that,must,confirmit
chapter,xxviii,nothing,occurred,during,the,next,three,or,four,days,to
make,elinor,regret,what,she,had,done,in,applying,to,her,mother
for,willoughby,neither,came,norwrote
they,were,engaged,about,the,end,of,that,time,to,attend,lady
middleton,to,a,party,from,which,mrs,jennings,was,kept,away,by
the,indisposition,of,her,youngest,daughter,and,for,this,party,marianne,wholly
dispirited,careless,of,her,appearance,and,seeming,equally,indifferent,whether,she,went
or,staid,prepared,without,one,look,of,hope,or,one,expression,of
pleasure
she,sat,by,the,drawing,room,fire,after,tea,till,the,moment
of,lady,middleton,s,arrival,without,once,stirring,from,her,seat,or
altering,her,attitude,lost,in,her,own,thoughts,and,insensible,of,her
sister,s,presence,and,when,at,last,they,were,told,that,lady
middleton,waited,for,them,at,the,door,she,started,as,if,she
had,forgotten,that,any,one,wasexpected
they,arrived,in,due,time,at,the,place,of,destination,and,as
soon,as,the,string,of,carriages,before,them,would,allow,alighted,ascended
the,stairs,heard,their,names,announced,from,one,landing,place,to,another
in,an,audible,voice,and,entered,a,room,splendidly,lit,up,quite
full,of,company,and,insufferablyhot
when,they,had,paid,their,tribute,of,politeness,by,curtsying,to,the
lady,of,the,house,they,were,permitted,to,mingle,in,the,crowd
and,take,their,share,of,the,heat,and,inconvenience,to,which,their
arrival,must,necessarilyadd
after,some,time,spent,in,saying,little,or,doing,less,lady,middleton
sat,down,to,cassino,and,as,marianne,was,not,in,spirits,for
moving,about,she,and,elinor,luckily,succeeding,to,chairs,placed,themselves,at
no,great,distance,from,thetable
they,had,not,remained,in,this,manner,long,before,elinor,perceived,willoughby
standing,within,a,few,yards,of,them,in,earnest,conversation,with,a
very,fashionable,looking,youngwoman
she,soon,caught,his,eye,and,he,immediately,bowed,but,without,attempting
to,speak,to,her,or,to,approach,marianne,though,he,could,not
but,see,her,and,then,continued,his,discourse,with,the,samelady
elinor,turned,involuntarily,to,marianne,to,see,whether,it,could,be,unobserved
byher
at,that,moment,she,first,perceived,him,and,her,whole,countenance,glowing
with,sudden,delight,she,would,have,moved,towards,him,instantly,had,not
her,sister,caught,hold,ofher
goodheavens
she,exclaimed,he,is,there,he,is,thereoh
why,does,he,not,look,atme
why,cannot,i,speak,tohim
pray,pray,be,composed,cried,elinor,and,do,not,betray,what,you
feel,to,every,bodypresent
perhaps,he,has,not,observed,youyet
this,however,was,more,than,she,could,believe,herself,and,to,be
composed,at,such,a,moment,was,not,only,beyond,the,reach,of
marianne,it,was,beyond,herwish
she,sat,in,an,agony,of,impatience,which,affected,everyfeature
illustration,_at,that,moment,she,first,perceived,him,_,at,last,he
turned,round,again,and,regarded,them,both,she,started,up,and,pronouncing
his,name,in,a,tone,of,affection,held,out,her,hand,to
him
he,approached,and,addressing,himself,rather,to,elinor,than,marianne,as,if
wishing,to,avoid,her,eye,and,determined,not,to,observe,her,attitude
inquired,in,a,hurried,manner,after,mrs,dashwood,and,asked,how,long
they,had,been,intown
elinor,was,robbed,of,all,presence,of,mind,by,such,an,address
and,was,unable,to,say,aword
but,the,feelings,of,her,sister,were,instantlyexpressed
her,face,was,crimsoned,over,and,she,exclaimed,in,a,voice,of
the,greatest,emotion,goodgod
willoughby,what,is,the,meaning,ofthis
have,you,not,received,myletters
will,you,not,shake,hands,withme
he,could,not,then,avoid,it,but,her,touch,seemed,painful,to
him,and,he,held,her,hand,only,for,amoment
during,all,this,time,he,was,evidently,struggling,forcomposure
elinor,watched,his,countenance,and,saw,its,expression,becoming,moretranquil
after,a,moment,s,pause,he,spoke,withcalmness
i,did,myself,the,honour,of,calling,in,berkeley,street,last,tuesday
and,very,much,regretted,that,i,was,not,fortunate,enough,to,find
yourselves,and,mrs,jennings,athome
my,card,was,not,lost,ihope
but,have,you,not,received,mynotes
cried,marianne,in,the,wildestanxiety
here,is,some,mistake,i,am,sure,some,dreadfulmistake
what,can,be,the,meaning,ofit
tell,me,willoughby,for,heaven,s,sake,tell,me,what,is,the
matter
he,made,no,reply,his,complexion,changed,and,all,his,embarrassment,returned
but,as,if,on,catching,the,eye,of,the,young,lady,with
whom,he,had,been,previously,talking,he,felt,the,necessity,of,instant
exertion,he,recovered,himself,again,and,after,saying,yes,i,had,the
pleasure,of,receiving,the,information,of,your,arrival,in,town,which,you
were,so,good,as,to,send,me,turned,hastily,away,with,a
slight,bow,and,joined,hisfriend
marianne,now,looking,dreadfully,white,and,unable,to,stand,sunk,into,her
chair,and,elinor,expecting,every,moment,to,see,her,faint,tried,to
screen,her,from,the,observation,of,others,while,reviving,her,with,lavender
water
go,to,him,elinor,she,cried,as,soon,as,she,could,speak
and,force,him,to,come,tome
tell,him,i,must,see,him,again,must,speak,to,himinstantly
i,cannot,rest,i,shall,not,have,a,moment,s,peace,till
this,is,explained,some,dreadful,misapprehension,orother
oh,go,to,him,thismoment
how,can,that,bedone
no,my,dearest,marianne,you,mustwait
this,is,not,the,place,forexplanations
wait,only,tilltomorrow
with,difficulty,however,could,she,prevent,her,from,following,him,herself,and
to,persuade,her,to,check,her,agitation,to,wait,at,least,with
the,appearance,of,composure,till,she,might,speak,to,him,with,more
privacy,and,more,effect,was,impossible,for,marianne,continued,incessantly,to,give
way,in,a,low,voice,to,the,misery,of,her,feelings,by
exclamations,ofwretchedness
in,a,short,time,elinor,saw,willoughby,quit,the,room,by,the
door,towards,the,staircase,and,telling,marianne,that,he,was,gone,urged
the,impossibility,of,speaking,to,him,again,that,evening,as,a,fresh
argument,for,her,to,becalm
she,instantly,begged,her,sister,would,entreat,lady,middleton,to,take,them
home,as,she,was,too,miserable,to,stay,a,minutelonger
lady,middleton,though,in,the,middle,of,a,rubber,on,being,informed
that,marianne,was,unwell,was,too,polite,to,object,for,a,moment
to,her,wish,of,going,away,and,making,over,her,cards,to
a,friend,they,departed,as,soon,as,the,carriage,could,befound
scarcely,a,word,was,spoken,during,their,return,to,berkeleystreet
marianne,was,in,a,silent,agony,too,much,oppressed,even,for,tears
but,as,mrs,jennings,was,luckily,not,come,home,they,could,go
directly,to,their,own,room,where,hartshorn,restored,her,a,little,to
herself
she,was,soon,undressed,and,in,bed,and,as,she,seemed,desirous
of,being,alone,her,sister,then,left,her,and,while,she,waited
the,return,of,mrs,jennings,had,leisure,enough,for,thinking,over,the
past
that,some,kind,of,engagement,had,subsisted,between,willoughby,and,marianne,she
could,not,doubt,and,that,willoughby,was,weary,of,it,seemed,equally
clear,for,however,marianne,might,still,feed,her,own,wishes,_she_,could
not,attribute,such,behaviour,to,mistake,or,misapprehension,of,anykind
nothing,but,a,thorough,change,of,sentiment,could,account,forit
her,indignation,would,have,been,still,stronger,than,it,was,had,she
not,witnessed,that,embarrassment,which,seemed,to,speak,a,consciousness,of,his
own,misconduct,and,prevented,her,from,believing,him,so,unprincipled,as,to
have,been,sporting,with,the,affections,of,her,sister,from,the,first
without,any,design,that,would,bearinvestigation
absence,might,have,weakened,his,regard,and,convenience,might,have,determined,him
to,overcome,it,but,that,such,a,regard,had,formerly,existed,she
could,not,bring,herself,todoubt
as,for,marianne,on,the,pangs,which,so,unhappy,a,meeting,must
already,have,given,her,and,on,those,still,more,severe,which,might
await,her,in,its,probable,consequence,she,could,not,reflect,without,the
deepestconcern
her,own,situation,gained,in,the,comparison,for,while,she,could,_esteem_
edward,as,much,as,ever,however,they,might,be,divided,in,future
her,mind,might,be,alwayssupported
but,every,circumstance,that,could,embitter,such,an,evil,seemed,uniting,to
heighten,the,misery,of,marianne,in,a,final,separation,from,willoughby,in
an,immediate,and,irreconcilable,rupture,withhim
chapter,xxix,before,the,housemaid,had,lit,their,fire,the,next,day
or,the,sun,gained,any,power,over,a,cold,gloomy,morning,in
january,marianne,only,half,dressed,was,kneeling,against,one,of,the,window
seats,for,the,sake,of,all,the,little,light,she,could,command
from,it,and,writing,as,fast,as,a,continual,flow,of,tears
would,permither
in,this,situation,elinor,roused,from,sleep,by,her,agitation,and,sobs
first,perceived,her,and,after,observing,her,for,a,few,moments,with
silent,anxiety,said,in,a,tone,of,the,most,considerate,gentleness,marianne
may,i,ask,no,elinor,she,replied,ask,nothing,you,will,soon
knowall
the,sort,of,desperate,calmness,with,which,this,was,said,lasted,no
longer,than,while,she,spoke,and,was,immediately,followed,by,a,return
of,the,same,excessiveaffliction
it,was,some,minutes,before,she,could,go,on,with,her,letter
and,the,frequent,bursts,of,grief,which,still,obliged,her,at,intervals
to,withhold,her,pen,were,proofs,enough,of,her,feeling,how,more
than,probable,it,was,that,she,was,writing,for,the,last,time
towilloughby
elinor,paid,her,every,quiet,and,unobtrusive,attention,in,her,power,and
she,would,have,tried,to,sooth,and,tranquilize,her,still,more,had
not,marianne,entreated,her,with,all,the,eagerness,of,the,most,nervous
irritability,not,to,speak,to,her,for,theworld
in,such,circumstances,it,was,better,for,both,that,they,should,not
be,long,together,and,the,restless,state,of,marianne,s,mind,not
only,prevented,her,from,remaining,in,the,room,a,moment,after,she
was,dressed,but,requiring,at,once,solitude,and,continual,change,of,place
made,her,wander,about,the,house,till,breakfast,time,avoiding,the,sight
of,everybody
at,breakfast,she,neither,ate,nor,attempted,to,eat,any,thing,and
elinor,s,attention,was,then,all,employed,not,in,urging,her,not
in,pitying,her,nor,in,appearing,to,regard,her,but,in,endeavouring
to,engage,mrs,jennings,s,notice,entirely,toherself
as,this,was,a,favourite,meal,with,mrs,jennings,it,lasted,a
considerable,time,and,they,were,just,setting,themselves,after,it,round,the
common,working,table,when,a,letter,was,delivered,to,marianne,which,she
eagerly,caught,from,the,servant,and,turning,of,a,death,like,paleness
instantly,ran,out,of,theroom
elinor,who,saw,as,plainly,by,this,as,if,she,had,seen
the,direction,that,it,must,come,from,willoughby,felt,immediately,such,a
sickness,at,heart,as,made,her,hardly,able,to,hold,up,her
head,and,sat,in,such,a,general,tremor,as,made,her,fear
it,impossible,to,escape,mrs,jennings,snotice
that,good,lady,however,saw,only,that,marianne,had,received,a,letter
from,willoughby,which,appeared,to,her,a,very,good,joke,and,which
she,treated,accordingly,by,hoping,with,a,laugh,that,she,would,find
it,to,herliking
of,elinor,s,distress,she,was,too,busily,employed,in,measuring,lengths
of,worsted,for,her,rug,to,see,any,thing,at,all,and
calmly,continuing,her,talk,as,soon,as,marianne,disappeared,she,said,upon
my,word,i,never,saw,a,young,woman,so,desperately,in,love
in,mylife
_my_,girls,were,nothing,to,her,and,yet,they,used,to,be
foolish,enough,but,as,for,miss,marianne,she,is,quite,an,altered
creature
i,hope,from,the,bottom,of,my,heart,he,won,t,keep
her,waiting,much,longer,for,it,is,quite,grievous,to,see,her
look,so,ill,andforlorn
pray,when,are,they,to,bemarried
elinor,though,never,less,disposed,to,speak,than,at,that,moment,obliged
herself,to,answer,such,an,attack,as,this,and,therefore,trying,to
smile,replied,and,have,you,really,ma,am,talked,yourself,into,a
persuasion,of,my,sister,s,being,engaged,to,mrwilloughby
i,thought,it,had,been,only,a,joke,but,so,serious,a
question,seems,to,imply,more,and,i,must,beg,therefore,that,you
will,not,deceive,yourself,anylonger
i,do,assure,you,that,nothing,would,surprise,me,more,than,to
hear,of,their,being,going,to,bemarried
for,shame,for,shame,missdashwood
how,can,you,talkso
don,t,we,all,know,that,it,must,be,a,match,that
they,were,over,head,and,ears,in,love,with,each,other,from
the,first,moment,theymet

and,you,will,find,that,you,have,though,you,will,not,believe
menow
mrs,jennings,laughed,again,but,elinor,had,not,spirits,to,say,more
and,eager,at,all,events,to,know,what,willoughby,had,written,hurried
away,to,their,room,where,on,opening,the,door,she,saw,marianne
stretched,on,the,bed,almost,choked,by,grief,one,letter,in,her
hand,and,two,or,three,others,laying,byher
elinor,drew,near,but,without,saying,a,word,and,seating,herself,on
the,bed,took,her,hand,kissed,her,affectionately,several,times,and,then
gave,way,to,a,burst,of,tears,which,at,first,was,scarcely
less,violent,than,mariannes
the,latter,though,unable,to,speak,seemed,to,feel,all,the,tenderness
of,this,behaviour,and,after,some,time,thus,spent,in,joint,affliction
she,put,all,the,letters,into,elinor,s,hands,and,then,covering
her,face,with,her,handkerchief,almost,screamed,withagony
elinor,who,knew,that,such,grief,shocking,as,it,was,to,witness
it,must,have,its,course,watched,by,her,till,this,excess,of
suffering,had,somewhat,spent,itself,and,then,turning,eagerly,to,willoughby,s
letter,read,as,follows,bond,streetjanuary
my,dear,madam,i,have,just,had,the,honour,of,receiving,your
letter,for,which,i,beg,to,return,my,sincereacknowledgments
i,am,much,concerned,to,find,there,was,anything,in,my,behaviour
last,night,that,did,not,meet,your,approbation,and,though,i,am
quite,at,a,loss,to,discover,in,what,point,i,could,be
so,unfortunate,as,to,offend,you,i,entreat,your,forgiveness,of,what
i,can,assure,you,to,have,been,perfectlyunintentional
i,shall,never,reflect,on,my,former,acquaintance,with,your,family,in
devonshire,without,the,most,grateful,pleasure,and,flatter,myself,it,will,not
be,broken,by,any,mistake,or,misapprehension,of,myactions
my,esteem,for,your,whole,family,is,very,sincere,but,if,i
have,been,so,unfortunate,as,to,give,rise,to,a,belief,of
more,than,i,felt,or,meant,to,express,i,shall,reproach,myself
for,not,having,been,more,guarded,in,my,professions,of,thatesteem
that,i,should,ever,have,meant,more,you,will,allow,to,be
impossible,when,you,understand,that,my,affections,have,been,long,engaged,elsewhere
and,it,will,not,be,many,weeks,i,believe,before,this,engagement
isfulfilled
it,is,with,great,regret,that,i,obey,your,commands,in,returning
the,letters,with,which,i,have,been,honoured,from,you,and,the
lock,of,hair,which,you,so,obligingly,bestowed,onme
i,am,dear,madam,your,most,obedient,humble,servant,johnwilloughby
with,what,indignation,such,a,letter,as,this,must,be,read,by
miss,dashwood,may,beimagined
though,aware,before,she,began,it,that,it,must,bring,a,confession
of,his,inconstancy,and,confirm,their,separation,for,ever,she,was,not
aware,that,such,language,could,be,suffered,to,announce,it,nor,could
she,have,supposed,willoughby,capable,of,departing,so,far,from,the,appearance
of,every,honourable,and,delicate,feeling,so,far,from,the,common,decorum
of,a,gentleman,as,to,send,a,letter,so,impudently,cruel,a
letter,which,instead,of,bringing,with,his,desire,of,a,release,any
professions,of,regret,acknowledged,no,breach,of,faith,denied,all,peculiar,affection
whatever,a,letter,of,which,every,line,was,an,insult,and,which
proclaimed,its,writer,to,be,deep,in,hardenedvillainy
she,paused,over,it,for,some,time,with,indignant,astonishment,then,read
it,again,and,again,but,every,perusal,only,served,to,increase,her
abhorrence,of,the,man,and,so,bitter,were,her,feelings,against,him
that,she,dared,not,trust,herself,to,speak,lest,she,might,wound
marianne,still,deeper,by,treating,their,disengagement,not,as,a,loss,to
her,of,any,possible,good,but,as,an,escape,from,the,worst
and,most,irremediable,of,all,evils,a,connection,for,life,with,an
unprincipled,man,as,a,deliverance,the,most,real,a,blessing,the,most
important
in,her,earnest,meditations,on,the,contents,of,the,letter,on,the
depravity,of,that,mind,which,could,dictate,it,and,probably,on,the
very,different,mind,of,a,very,different,person,who,had,no,other
connection,whatever,with,the,affair,than,what,her,heart,gave,him,with
every,thing,that,passed,elinor,forgot,the,immediate,distress,of,her,sister
forgot,that,she,had,three,letters,on,her,lap,yet,unread,and
so,entirely,forgot,how,long,she,had,been,in,the,room,that
when,on,hearing,a,carriage,drive,up,to,the,door,she,went
to,the,window,to,see,who,could,be,coming,so,unreasonably,early
she,was,all,astonishment,to,perceive,mrs,jennings,s,chariot,which,she
knew,had,not,been,ordered,tillone
determined,not,to,quit,marianne,though,hopeless,of,contributing,at,present,to
her,ease,she,hurried,away,to,excuse,herself,from,attending,mrs,jennings
on,account,of,her,sister,beingindisposed
mrs,jennings,with,a,thoroughly,good,humoured,concern,for,its,cause,admitted
the,excuse,most,readily,and,elinor,after,seeing,her,safe,off,returned
to,marianne,whom,she,found,attempting,to,rise,from,the,bed,and
whom,she,reached,just,in,time,to,prevent,her,from,falling,on
the,floor,faint,and,giddy,from,a,long,want,of,proper,rest
and,food,for,it,was,many,days,since,she,had,any,appetite
and,many,nights,since,she,had,really,slept,and,now,when,her
mind,was,no,longer,supported,by,the,fever,of,suspense,the,consequence
of,all,this,was,felt,in,an,aching,head,a,weakened,stomach
and,a,general,nervousfaintness
a,glass,of,wine,which,elinor,procured,for,her,directly,made,her
more,comfortable,and,she,was,at,last,able,to,express,some,sense
of,her,kindness,by,saying,poorelinor
how,unhappy,i,makeyou

elinor,said,no,more,and,turning,again,to,the,three,letters,which
now,raised,a,much,stronger,curiosity,than,before,directly,ran,over,the
contents,ofall
the,first,which,was,what,her,sister,had,sent,him,on,their
arrival,in,town,was,to,this,effect,berkeley,streetjanuary
how,surprised,you,will,be,willoughby,on,receiving,this,and,i,think
you,will,feel,something,more,than,surprise,when,you,know,that,i
am,intown
an,opportunity,of,coming,hither,though,with,mrs,jennings,was,a,temptation
we,could,notresist
i,wish,you,may,receive,this,in,time,to,come,here,tonight
but,i,will,not,depend,onit
at,any,rate,i,shall,expect,you,tomorrow
for,the,presentadieu
md
her,second,note,which,had,been,written,on,the,morning,after,the
dance,at,the,middletons,was,in,these,words,i,cannot,express,my
disappointment,in,having,missed,you,the,day,before,yesterday,nor,my,astonishment
at,not,having,received,any,answer,to,a,note,which,i,sent
you,above,a,weekago
i,have,been,expecting,to,hear,from,you,and,still,more,to
see,you,every,hour,of,theday
pray,call,again,as,soon,as,possible,and,explain,the,reason,of
my,having,expected,this,invain
you,had,better,come,earlier,another,time,because,we,are,generally,out
byone
we,were,last,night,at,lady,middleton,s,where,there,was,a
dance
i,have,been,told,that,you,were,asked,to,be,of,the
party
but,could,it,beso
you,must,be,very,much,altered,indeed,since,we,parted,if,that
could,be,the,case,and,you,notthere
but,i,will,not,suppose,this,possible,and,i,hope,very,soon
to,receive,your,personal,assurance,of,its,beingotherwise
md
the,contents,of,her,last,note,to,him,were,these,what,am
i,to,imagine,willoughby,by,your,behaviour,lastnight
again,i,demand,an,explanation,ofit
i,was,prepared,to,meet,you,with,the,pleasure,which,our,separation
naturally,produced,with,the,familiarity,which,our,intimacy,at,barton,appeared,to
me,tojustify
i,was,repulsedindeed
i,have,passed,a,wretched,night,in,endeavouring,to,excuse,a,conduct
which,can,scarcely,be,called,less,than,insulting,but,though,i,have
not,yet,been,able,to,form,any,reasonable,apology,for,your,behaviour
i,am,perfectly,ready,to,hear,your,justification,ofit
you,have,perhaps,been,misinformed,or,purposely,deceived,in,something,concerning,me
which,may,have,lowered,me,in,youropinion
tell,me,what,it,is,explain,the,grounds,on,which,you,acted
and,i,shall,be,satisfied,in,being,able,to,satisfyyou
it,would,grieve,me,indeed,to,be,obliged,to,think,ill,of
you,but,if,i,am,to,do,it,if,i,am,to
learn,that,you,are,not,what,we,have,hitherto,believed,you,that
your,regard,for,us,all,was,insincere,that,your,behaviour,to,me
was,intended,only,to,deceive,let,it,be,told,as,soon,as
possible
my,feelings,are,at,present,in,a,state,of,dreadful,indecision,i
wish,to,acquit,you,but,certainty,on,either,side,will,be,ease
to,what,i,nowsuffer
if,your,sentiments,are,no,longer,what,they,were,you,will,return
my,notes,and,the,lock,of,my,hair,which,is,in,your
possession
md
that,such,letters,so,full,of,affection,and,confidence,could,have,been
so,answered,elinor,for,willoughby,s,sake,would,have,been,unwilling,to
believe
but,her,condemnation,of,him,did,not,blind,her,to,the,impropriety
of,their,having,been,written,at,all,and,she,was,silently,grieving
over,the,imprudence,which,had,hazarded,such,unsolicited,proofs,of,tenderness,not
warranted,by,anything,preceding,and,most,severely,condemned,by,the,event,when
marianne,perceiving,that,she,had,finished,the,letters,observed,to,her,that
they,contained,nothing,but,what,any,one,would,have,written,in,the
samesituation
i,felt,myself,she,added,to,be,as,solemnly,engaged,to,him
as,if,the,strictest,legal,covenant,had,bound,us,to,eachother

if,she,supposed,her,young,friend,s,affliction,could,be,increased,by
noise
marianne,to,the,surprise,of,her,sister,determined,on,dining,withthem
elinor,even,advised,her,againstit
but,no,she,would,go,down,she,could,bear,it,very,well

as,she,could,while,marianne,still,remained,on,the,bed,was,ready

summoned,toit
when,there,though,looking,most,wretchedly,she,ate,more,and,was,calmer
than,her,sister,hadexpected
had,she,tried,to,speak,or,had,she,been,conscious,of,half
mrs,jennings,s,well,meant,but,ill,judged,attentions,to,her,this
calmness,could,not,have,been,maintained,but,not,a,syllable,escaped,her
lips,and,the,abstraction,of,her,thoughts,preserved,her,in,ignorance,of

elinor,who,did,justice,to,mrs,jennings,s,kindness,though,its,effusions
were,often,distressing,and,sometimes,almost,ridiculous,made,her,those,acknowledgments,and
returned,her,those,civilities,which,her,sister,could,not,make,or,return
forherself
their,good,friend,saw,that,marianne,was,unhappy,and,felt,that,every
thing,was,due,to,her,which,might,make,her,at,all,less
so
she,treated,her,therefore,with,all,the,indulgent,fondness,of,a,parent
towards,a,favourite,child,on,the,last,day,of,itsholidays
marianne,was,to,have,the,best,place,by,the,fire,was,to

palmer,and,sir,john,against,ever,naming,mr,willoughby,or,making,the
slightest,allusion,to,what,has,passed,before,mysister
their,own,good,nature,must,point,out,to,them,the,real,cruelty
of,appearing,to,know,any,thing,about,it,when,she,is,present
and,the,less,that,may,ever,be,said,to,myself,on,the
subject,the,more,my,feelings,will,be,spared,as,you,my,dear

yes,that,i,doindeed

and,what,does,talking,ever,do,youknow
in,this,affair,it,can,only,do,harm,more,so,perhaps,than
in,many,cases,of,a,similar,kind,for,it,has,been,attended
by,circumstances,which,for,the,sake,of,every,one,concerned,in,it
make,it,unfit,to,become,the,publicconversation
i,must,do,_this_,justice,to,mr,willoughby,he,has,broken,no
positive,engagement,with,mysister
law,mydear
don,t,pretend,to,defendhim
no,positive,engagementindeed
after,taking,her,all,over,allenham,house,and,fixing,on,the,very
rooms,they,were,to,live,inhereafter
elinor,for,her,sister,s,sake,could,not,press,the,subject,farther
and,she,hoped,it,was,not,required,of,her,for,willoughby,s
since,though,marianne,might,lose,much,he,could,gain,very,little,by
the,enforcement,of,the,realtruth
after,a,short,silence,on,both,sides,mrs,jennings,with,all,her
natural,hilarity,burst,forthagain

out,at,a,small,cost,and,then,what,does,itsignify
delaford,is,a,nice,place,i,can,tell,you,exactly,what,i
call,a,nice,old,fashioned,place,full,of,comforts,and,conveniences,quite
shut,in,with,great,garden,walls,that,are,covered,with,the,best
fruit,trees,in,the,country,and,such,a,mulberry,tree,in,one
corner
lord
how,charlotte,and,i,did,stuff,the,only,time,we,werethere
then,there,is,a,dovecote,some,delightful,stew,ponds,and,a,very
pretty,canal,and,every,thing,in,short,that,one,could,wish,for
and,moreover,it,is,close,to,the,church,and,only,a,quarter
of,a,mile,from,the,turnpike,road,so,tis,never,dull,for
if,you,only,go,and,sit,up,in,an,old,yew,arbour
behind,the,house,you,may,see,all,the,carriages,that,passalong
oh
tis,a,niceplace
a,butcher,hard,by,in,the,village,and,the,parsonage,house,within
a,stone,sthrow
to,my,fancy,a,thousand,times,prettier,than,barton,park,where,they
are,forced,to,send,three,miles,for,their,meat,and,have,not
a,neighbour,nearer,than,yourmother
well,i,shall,spirit,up,the,colonel,as,soon,as,ican
one,shoulder,of,mutton,you,know,drives,anotherdown
if,we,_can_,but,put,willoughby,out,of,herhead
ay,if,we,can,do,that,ma,am,said,elinor,we,shall
do,very,well,with,or,without,colonelbrandon
and,then,rising,she,went,away,to,join,marianne,whom,she,found
as,she,expected,in,her,own,room,leaning,in,silent,misery,over
the,small,remains,of,a,fire,which,till,elinor,s,entrance,had
been,her,onlylight
you,had,better,leave,me,was,all,the,notice,that,her,sister
received,fromher
i,will,leave,you,said,elinor,if,you,will,go,tobed
but,this,from,the,momentary,perverseness,of,impatient,suffering,she,at,first
refused,todo
her,sister,s,earnest,though,gentle,persuasion,however,soon,softened,her,to
compliance,and,elinor,saw,her,lay,her,aching,head,on,the,pillow
and,as,she,hoped,in,a,way,to,get,some,quiet,rest
before,she,lefther
in,the,drawing,room,whither,she,then,repaired,she,was,soon,joined
by,mrs,jennings,with,a,wine,glass,full,of,something,in,her
hand
my,dear,said,she,entering,i,have,just,recollected,that,i,have
some,of,the,finest,old,constantia,wine,in,the,house,that,ever
was,tasted,so,i,have,brought,a,glass,of,it,for,your
sister
my,poorhusband
how,fond,he,was,ofit
whenever,he,had,a,touch,of,his,old,colicky,gout,he,said
it,did,him,more,good,than,any,thing,else,in,theworld
do,take,it,to,yoursister
dear,ma,am,replied,elinor,smiling,at,the,difference,of,the,complaints
for,which,it,was,recommended,how,good,youare
but,i,have,just,left,marianne,in,bed,and,i,hope,almost
asleep,and,as,i,think,nothing,will,be,of,so,much,service
to,her,as,rest,if,you,will,give,me,leave,i,will
drink,the,winemyself
mrs,jennings,though,regretting,that,she,had,not,been,five,minutes,earlier
was,satisfied,with,the,compromise,and,elinor,as,she,swallowed,the,chief
of,it,reflected,that,though,its,effects,on,a,colicky,gout,were
at,present,of,little,importance,to,her,its,healing,powers,on,a
disappointed,heart,might,be,as,reasonably,tried,on,herself,as,on,her
sister
colonel,brandon,came,in,while,the,party,were,at,tea,and,by
his,manner,of,looking,round,the,room,for,marianne,elinor,immediately,fancied
that,he,neither,expected,nor,wished,to,see,her,there,and,in
short,that,he,was,already,aware,of,what,occasioned,herabsence
mrs,jennings,was,not,struck,by,the,same,thought,for,soon,after
his,entrance,she,walked,across,the,room,to,the,tea,table,where
elinor,presided,and,whispered,the,colonel,looks,as,grave,as,ever,you
see
he,knows,nothing,of,it,do,tell,him,mydear
illustration,_how,fond,he,was,of,it,_,he,shortly,afterwards,drew
a,chair,close,to,her,s,and,with,a,look,which,perfectly
assured,her,of,his,good,information,inquired,after,hersister
marianne,is,not,well,saidshe
she,has,been,indisposed,all,day,and,we,have,persuaded,her,to
go,tobed
perhaps,then,he,hesitatingly,replied,what,i,heard,this,morning,may,be
there,may,be,more,truth,in,it,than,i,could,believe,possible
atfirst
what,did,youhear
that,a,gentleman,whom,i,had,reason,to,think,in,short,that
a,man,whom,i,_knew_,to,be,engaged,but,how,shall,i
tellyou
if,you,know,it,already,as,surely,you,must,i,may,be
spared
you,mean,answered,elinor,with,forced,calmness,mr,willoughby,s,marriage,with
missgrey
yes,we,_do_,know,itall
this,seems,to,have,been,a,day,of,general,elucidation,for,this
very,morning,first,unfolded,it,tous
mr,willoughby,isunfathomable
where,did,you,hearit
in,a,stationer,s,shop,in,pall,mall,where,i,hadbusiness
two,ladies,were,waiting,for,their,carriage,and,one,of,them,was
giving,the,other,an,account,of,the,intended,match,in,a,voice
so,little,attempting,concealment,that,it,was,impossible,for,me,not,to
hearall
the,name,of,willoughby,john,willoughby,frequently,repeated,first,caught,my,attention
and,what,followed,was,a,positive,assertion,that,every,thing,was,now
finally,settled,respecting,his,marriage,with,miss,grey,it,was,no,longer
to,be,a,secret,it,would,take,place,even,within,a,few
weeks,with,many,particulars,of,preparations,and,othermatters
one,thing,especially,i,remember,because,it,served,to,identify,the,man
still,more,as,soon,as,the,ceremony,was,over,they,were,to
go,to,combe,magna,his,seat,insomersetshire
my,astonishment,but,it,would,be,impossible,to,describe,what,ifelt
the,communicative,lady,i,learnt,on,inquiry,for,i,stayed,in,the
shop,till,they,were,gone,was,a,mrs,ellison,and,that,as
i,have,been,since,informed,is,the,name,of,miss,grey,s
guardian
itis
but,have,you,likewise,heard,that,miss,grey,has,fifty,thousandpounds
in,that,if,in,any,thing,we,may,find,anexplanation
it,may,be,so,but,willoughby,is,capable,at,least,i,think
he,stopped,a,moment,then,added,in,a,voice,which,seemed,to
distrust,itself,and,your,sister,how,did,she,her,sufferings,have,been
verysevere
i,have,only,to,hope,that,they,may,be,proportionatelyshort
it,has,been,it,is,a,most,cruelaffliction
till,yesterday,i,believe,she,never,doubted,his,regard,and,even,now
perhaps,but,_i_,am,almost,convinced,that,he,never,was,really,attached
toher
he,has,been,verydeceitful
and,in,some,points,there,seems,a,hardness,of,heart,abouthim
ah
said,colonel,brandon,there,isindeed
but,your,sister,does,not,i,think,you,said,so,she,does
not,consider,quite,as,youdo
you,know,her,disposition,and,may,believe,how,eagerly,she,would,still
justify,him,if,shecould
he,made,no,answer,and,soon,afterwards,by,the,removal,of,the
tea,things,and,the,arrangement,of,the,card,parties,the,subject,was
necessarilydropped
mrs,jennings,who,had,watched,them,with,pleasure,while,they,were,talking
and,who,expected,to,see,the,effect,of,miss,dashwood,s,communication
in,such,an,instantaneous,gaiety,on,colonel,brandon,s,side,as,might
have,become,a,man,in,the,bloom,of,youth,of,hope,and
happiness,saw,him,with,amazement,remain,the,whole,evening,more,serious,and
thoughtful,thanusual
chapter,xxxi,from,a,night,of,more,sleep,than,she,had,expected
marianne,awoke,the,next,morning,to,the,same,consciousness,of,misery,in
which,she,had,closed,hereyes
elinor,encouraged,her,as,much,as,possible,to,talk,of,what,she
felt,and,before,breakfast,was,ready,they,had,gone,through,the,subject
again,and,again,and,with,the,same,steady,conviction,and,affectionate,counsel
on,elinor,s,side,the,same,impetuous,feelings,and,varying,opinions,on
marianne,s,asbefore
sometimes,she,could,believe,willoughby,to,be,as,unfortunate,and,as,innocent
as,herself,and,at,others,lost,every,consolation,in,the,impossibility,of
acquittinghim
at,one,moment,she,was,absolutely,indifferent,to,the,observation,of,all
the,world,at,another,she,would,seclude,herself,from,it,for,ever
and,at,a,third,could,resist,it,withenergy
in,one,thing,however,she,was,uniform,when,it,came,to,the
point,in,avoiding,where,it,was,possible,the,presence,of,mrs,jennings
and,in,a,determined,silence,when,obliged,to,endureit
her,heart,was,hardened,against,the,belief,of,mrs,jennings,s,entering
into,her,sorrows,with,anycompassion
no,no,no,it,cannot,be,she,cried,she,cannotfeel
her,kindness,is,not,sympathy,her,good,nature,is,nottenderness
all,that,she,wants,is,gossip,and,she,only,likes,me,now
because,i,supplyit
elinor,had,not,needed,this,to,be,assured,of,the,injustice,to
which,her,sister,was,often,led,in,her,opinion,of,others,by
the,irritable,refinement,of,her,own,mind,and,the,too,great,importance
placed,by,her,on,the,delicacies,of,a,strong,sensibility,and,the
graces,of,a,polishedmanner
like,half,the,rest,of,the,world,if,more,than,half,there
be,that,are,clever,and,good,marianne,with,excellent,abilities,and,an
excellent,disposition,was,neither,reasonable,norcandid
she,expected,from,other,people,the,same,opinions,and,feelings,as,her
own,and,she,judged,of,their,motives,by,the,immediate,effect,of
their,actions,onherself
thus,a,circumstance,occurred,while,the,sisters,were,together,in,their,own
room,after,breakfast,which,sunk,the,heart,of,mrs,jennings,still,lower
in,her,estimation,because,through,her,own,weakness,it,chanced,to,prove
a,source,of,fresh,pain,to,herself,though,mrs,jennings,was,governed
in,it,by,an,impulse,of,the,utmost,goodwill
with,a,letter,in,her,outstretched,hand,and,countenance,gaily,smiling,from
the,persuasion,of,bringing,comfort,she,entered,their,room,saying,now,my
dear,i,bring,you,something,that,i,am,sure,will,do,you
good
marianne,heardenough
in,one,moment,her,imagination,placed,before,her,a,letter,from,willoughby
full,of,tenderness,and,contrition,explanatory,of,all,that,had,passed,satisfactory
convincing,and,instantly,followed,by,willoughby,himself,rushing,eagerly,into,the,room
to,enforce,at,her,feet,by,the,eloquence,of,his,eyes,the
assurances,of,hisletter
the,work,of,one,moment,was,destroyed,by,thenext
the,hand,writing,of,her,mother,never,till,then,unwelcome,was,before
her,and,in,the,acuteness,of,the,disappointment,which,followed,such,an
ecstasy,of,more,than,hope,she,felt,as,if,till,that,instant
she,had,neversuffered
the,cruelty,of,mrs,jennings,no,language,within,her,reach,in,her
moments,of,happiest,eloquence,could,have,expressed,and,now,she,could,reproach
her,only,by,the,tears,which,streamed,from,her,eyes,with,passionate
violence,a,reproach,however,so,entirely,lost,on,its,object,that,after
many,expressions,of,pity,she,withdrew,still,referring,her,to,the,letter
ofcomfort
but,the,letter,when,she,was,calm,enough,to,read,it,brought
littlecomfort
willoughby,filled,everypage
her,mother,still,confident,of,their,engagement,and,relying,as,warmly,as
ever,on,his,constancy,had,only,been,roused,by,elinor,s,application
to,entreat,from,marianne,greater,openness,towards,them,both,and,this,with
such,tenderness,towards,her,such,affection,for,willoughby,and,such,a,conviction
of,their,future,happiness,in,each,other,that,she,wept,with,agony
through,the,whole,ofit
all,her,impatience,to,be,at,home,again,now,returned,her,mother
was,dearer,to,her,than,ever,dearer,through,the,very,excess,of
her,mistaken,confidence,in,willoughby,and,she,was,wildly,urgent,to,be
gone
elinor,unable,herself,to,determine,whether,it,were,better,for,marianne,to
be,in,london,or,at,barton,offered,no,counsel,of,her,own
except,of,patience,till,their,mother,s,wishes,could,be,known,and
at,length,she,obtained,her,sister,s,consent,to,wait,for,that
knowledge
mrs,jennings,left,them,earlier,than,usual,for,she,could,not,be
easy,till,the,middletons,and,palmers,were,able,to,grieve,as,much
as,herself,and,positively,refusing,elinor,s,offered,attendance,went,out,alone
for,the,rest,of,themorning
elinor,with,a,very,heavy,heart,aware,of,the,pain,she,was
going,to,communicate,and,perceiving,by,marianne,s,letter,how,ill,she
had,succeeded,in,laying,any,foundation,for,it,then,sat,down,to
write,her,mother,an,account,of,what,had,passed,and,entreat,her
directions,for,the,future,while,marianne,who,came,into,the,drawing,room
on,mrs,jennings,s,going,away,remained,fixed,at,the,table,where
elinor,wrote,watching,the,advancement,of,her,pen,grieving,over,her,for
the,hardship,of,such,a,task,and,grieving,still,more,fondly,over
its,effect,on,hermother
in,this,manner,they,had,continued,about,a,quarter,of,an,hour
when,marianne,whose,nerves,could,not,then,bear,any,sudden,noise,was

dance,in,which,i,alluded,to,a,lady,i,had,once,known
as,resembling,in,some,measure,your,sistermarianne
indeed,answered,elinor,i,have,_not_,forgottenit
he,looked,pleased,by,this,remembrance,and,added,if,i,am,not
deceived,by,the,uncertainty,the,partiality,of,tender,recollection,there,is,a
very,strong,resemblance,between,them,as,well,in,mind,asperson
the,same,warmth,of,heart,the,same,eagerness,of,fancy,andspirits
this,lady,was,one,of,my,nearest,relations,an,orphan,from,her
infancy,and,under,the,guardianship,of,myfather
our,ages,were,nearly,the,same,and,from,our,earliest,years,we
were,playfellows,andfriends
i,cannot,remember,the,time,when,i,did,not,love,eliza,and
my,affection,for,her,as,we,grew,up,was,such,as,perhaps
judging,from,my,present,forlorn,and,cheerless,gravity,you,might,think,me
incapable,of,having,everfelt
her,s,for,me,was,i,believe,fervent,as,the,attachment,of
your,sister,to,mr,willoughby,and,it,was,though,from,a,different
cause,no,lessunfortunate
at,seventeen,she,was,lost,to,me,forever
she,was,married,married,against,her,inclination,to,mybrother
her,fortune,was,large,and,our,family,estate,muchencumbered
and,this,i,fear,is,all,that,can,be,said,for,the
conduct,of,one,who,was,at,once,her,uncle,andguardian
my,brother,did,not,deserve,her,he,did,not,even,loveher
i,had,hoped,that,her,regard,for,me,would,support,her,under
any,difficulty,and,for,some,time,it,did,but,at,last,the
misery,of,her,situation,for,she,experienced,great,unkindness,overcame,all,her
resolution,and,though,she,had,promised,me,that,nothing,but,how,blindly
irelate
i,have,never,told,you,how,this,was,broughton
we,were,within,a,few,hours,of,eloping,together,forscotland
the,treachery,or,the,folly,of,my,cousin,s,maid,betrayedus
i,was,banished,to,the,house,of,a,relation,far,distant,and
she,was,allowed,no,liberty,no,society,no,amusement,till,my,father
s,point,wasgained
i,had,depended,on,her,fortitude,too,far,and,the,blow,was
a,severe,one,but,had,her,marriage,been,happy,so,young,as
i,then,was,a,few,months,must,have,reconciled,me,to,it
or,at,least,i,should,not,have,now,to,lamentit
this,however,was,not,thecase
my,brother,had,no,regard,for,her,his,pleasures,were,not,what
they,ought,to,have,been,and,from,the,first,he,treated,her
unkindly
the,consequence,of,this,upon,a,mind,so,young,so,lively,so
inexperienced,as,mrs,brandon,s,was,but,toonatural
she,resigned,herself,at,first,to,all,the,misery,of,her,situation
and,happy,had,it,been,if,she,had,not,lived,to,overcome
those,regrets,which,the,remembrance,of,meoccasioned
but,can,we,wonder,that,with,such,a,husband,to,provoke,inconstancy
and,without,a,friend,to,advise,or,restrain,her,for,my,father
lived,only,a,few,months,after,their,marriage,and,i,was,with
my,regiment,in,the,east,indies,she,shouldfall
had,i,remained,in,england,perhaps,but,i,meant,to,promote,the
happiness,of,both,by,removing,from,her,for,years,and,for,that
purpose,had,procured,myexchange
the,shock,which,her,marriage,had,given,me,he,continued,in,a
voice,of,great,agitation,was,of,trifling,weight,was,nothing,to,what
i,felt,when,i,heard,about,two,years,afterwards,of,herdivorce
it,was,_that_,which,threw,this,gloom,even,now,the,recollection,of
what,i,suffered,he,could,say,no,more,and,rising,hastily,walked
for,a,few,minutes,about,theroom
elinor,affected,by,his,relation,and,still,more,by,his,distress,could
notspeak
he,saw,her,concern,and,coming,to,her,took,her,hand,pressed
it,and,kissed,it,with,gratefulrespect
a,few,minutes,more,of,silent,exertion,enabled,him,to,proceed,with
composure
it,was,nearly,three,years,after,this,unhappy,period,before,i,returned
toengland
my,first,care,when,i,_did_,arrive,was,of,course,to,seek
for,her,but,the,search,was,as,fruitless,as,it,wasmelancholy
i,could,not,trace,her,beyond,her,first,seducer,and,there,was
every,reason,to,fear,that,she,had,removed,from,him,only,to
sink,deeper,in,a,life,ofsin
her,legal,allowance,was,not,adequate,to,her,fortune,nor,sufficient,for
her,comfortable,maintenance,and,i,learnt,from,my,brother,that,the,power
of,receiving,it,had,been,made,over,some,months,before,to,another
person
he,imagined,and,calmly,could,he,imagine,it,that,her,extravagance,and
consequent,distress,had,obliged,her,to,dispose,of,it,for,some,immediate
relief
at,last,however,and,after,i,had,been,six,months,in,england
i,_did_,findher
regard,for,a,former,servant,of,my,own,who,had,since,fallen
into,misfortune,carried,me,to,visit,him,in,a,spunging,house,where
he,was,confined,for,debt,and,there,in,the,same,house,under
a,similar,confinement,was,my,unfortunatesister
so,altered,so,faded,worn,down,by,acute,suffering,of,everykind
hardly,could,i,believe,the,melancholy,and,sickly,figure,before,me,to
be,the,remains,of,the,lovely,blooming,healthful,girl,on,whom,i
had,oncedoted

life,could,do,nothing,for,her,beyond,giving,time,for,a,better
preparation,for,death,and,that,wasgiven
i,saw,her,placed,in,comfortable,lodgings,and,under,proper,attendants,i
visited,her,every,day,during,the,rest,of,her,short,life,i
was,with,her,in,her,lastmoments
again,he,stopped,to,recover,himself,and,elinor,spoke,her,feelings,in
an,exclamation,of,tender,concern,at,the,fate,of,his,unfortunatefriend

i,have,discharged,it,in,the,strictest,sense,by,watching,over,her
education,myself,had,the,nature,of,our,situations,allowed,it,but,i
had,no,family,no,home,and,my,little,eliza,was,therefore,placed

my,brother,which,happened,about,five,years,ago,and,which,left,to
me,the,possession,of,the,family,property,she,visited,me,atdelaford
i,called,her,a,distant,relation,but,i,am,well,aware,that
i,have,in,general,been,suspected,of,a,much,nearer,connection,with
her
it,is,now,three,years,ago,she,had,just,reached,her,fourteenth
year,that,i,removed,her,from,school,to,place,her,under,the
care,of,a,very,respectable,woman,residing,in,dorsetshire,who,had,the
charge,of,four,or,five,other,girls,of,about,the,same,time
of,life,and,for,two,years,i,had,every,reason,to,be

but,last,february,almost,a,twelvemonth,back,she,suddenlydisappeared
i,had,allowed,her,imprudently,as,it,has,since,turned,out,at
her,earnest,desire,to,go,to,bath,with,one,of,her,young
friends,who,was,attending,her,father,there,for,hishealth
i,knew,him,to,be,a,very,good,sort,of,man,and

as,thoroughly,as,he,was,convinced,himself,of,his,daughter,s,being
entirely,unconcerned,in,thebusiness

chapter,xxxii,when,the,particulars,of,this,conversation,were,repeated,by,miss
dashwood,to,her,sister,as,they,very,soon,were,the,effect,on
her,was,not,entirely,such,as,the,former,had,hoped,tosee
not,that,marianne,appeared,to,distrust,the,truth,of,any,part,of
it,for,she,listened,to,it,all,with,the,most,steady,and
submissive,attention,made,neither,objection,nor,remark,attempted,no,vindication,of,willoughby
and,seemed,to,show,by,her,tears,that,she,felt,it,to
beimpossible
but,though,this,behaviour,assured,elinor,that,the,conviction,of,this,guilt
_was_,carried,home,to,her,mind,though,she,saw,with,satisfaction,the
effect,of,it,in,her,no,longer,avoiding,colonel,brandon,when,he
called,in,her,speaking,to,him,even,voluntarily,speaking,with,a,kind
of,compassionate,respect,and,though,she,saw,her,spirits,less,violently,irritated
than,before,she,did,not,see,her,lesswretched
her,mind,did,become,settled,but,it,was,settled,in,a,gloomy
dejection
she,felt,the,loss,of,willoughby,s,character,yet,more,heavily,than
she,had,felt,the,loss,of,his,heart,his,seduction,and,desertion
of,miss,williams,the,misery,of,that,poor,girl,and,the,doubt
of,what,his,designs,might,_once_,have,been,on,herself,preyed,altogether
so,much,on,her,spirits,that,she,could,not,bring,herself,to
speak,of,what,she,felt,even,to,elinor,and,brooding,over,her
sorrows,in,silence,gave,more,pain,to,her,sister,than,could,have
been,communicated,by,the,most,open,and,most,frequent,confession,ofthem
to,give,the,feelings,or,the,language,of,mrs,dashwood,on,receiving
and,answering,elinor,s,letter,would,be,only,to,give,a,repetition
of,what,her,daughters,had,already,felt,and,said,of,a,disappointment
hardly,less,painful,than,marianne,s,and,an,indignation,even,greater,than
elinors
long,letters,from,her,quickly,succeeding,each,other,arrived,to,tell,all
that,she,suffered,and,thought,to,express,her,anxious,solicitude,for,marianne
and,entreat,she,would,bear,up,with,fortitude,under,thismisfortune
bad,indeed,must,the,nature,of,marianne,s,affliction,be,when,her

mortifying,and,humiliating,must,be,the,origin,of,those,regrets,which,_she_
could,wish,her,not,toindulge
against,the,interest,of,her,own,individual,comfort,mrs,dashwood,had,determined
that,it,would,be,better,for,marianne,to,be,any,where,at
that,time,than,at,barton,where,every,thing,within,her,view,would
be,bringing,back,the,past,in,the,strongest,and,most,afflicting,manner
by,constantly,placing,willoughby,before,her,such,as,she,had,always,seen
himthere
she,recommended,it,to,her,daughters,therefore,by,all,means,not,to
shorten,their,visit,to,mrs,jennings,the,length,of,which,though,never
exactly,fixed,had,been,expected,by,all,to,comprise,at,least,five
or,sixweeks
a,variety,of,occupations,of,objects,and,of,company,which,could,not
be,procured,at,barton,would,be,inevitable,there,and,might,yet,she
hoped,cheat,marianne,at,times,into,some,interest,beyond,herself,and,even
into,some,amusement,much,as,the,ideas,of,both,might,now,be
spurned,byher
from,all,danger,of,seeing,willoughby,again,her,mother,considered,her,to
be,at,least,equally,safe,in,town,as,in,the,country,since
his,acquaintance,must,now,be,dropped,by,all,who,called,themselves,her
friends

never,leave,them,exposed,to,a,surprise,and,chance,had,less,in
its,favour,in,the,crowd,of,london,than,even,in,the,retirement
of,barton,where,it,might,force,him,before,her,while,paying,that
visit,at,allenham,on,his,marriage,which,mrs,dashwood,from,foreseeing,at
first,as,a,probable,event,had,brought,herself,to,expect,as,a
certainone
she,had,yet,another,reason,for,wishing,her,children,to,remain,where
they,were,a,letter,from,her,son,in,law,had,told,her
that,he,and,his,wife,were,to,be,in,town,before,the
middle,of,february,and,she,judged,it,right,that,they,should,sometimes
see,theirbrother
marianne,had,promised,to,be,guided,by,her,mother,s,opinion,and
she,submitted,to,it,therefore,without,opposition,though,it,proved,perfectly,different
from,what,she,wished,and,expected,though,she,felt,it,to,be
entirely,wrong,formed,on,mistaken,grounds,and,that,by,requiring,her,longer
continuance,in,london,it,deprived,her,of,the,only,possible,alleviation,of
her,wretchedness,the,personal,sympathy,of,her,mother,and,doomed,her,to
such,society,and,such,scenes,as,must,prevent,her,ever,knowing,a
moment,srest
but,it,was,a,matter,of,great,consolation,to,her,that,what
brought,evil,to,herself,would,bring,good,to,her,sister,and,elinor
on,the,other,hand,suspecting,that,it,would,not,be,in,her
power,to,avoid,edward,entirely,comforted,herself,by,thinking,that,though,their
longer,stay,would,therefore,militate,against,her,own,happiness,it,would,be
better,for,marianne,than,an,immediate,return,intodevonshire
her,carefulness,in,guarding,her,sister,from,ever,hearing,willoughby,s,name

to,more,than,its,real,value,and,she,was,sometimes,worried,down
by,officious,condolence,to,rate,good,breeding,as,more,indispensable,to,comfort

lady,middleton,expressed,her,sense,of,the,affair,about,once,every,day
or,twice,if,the,subject,occurred,very,often,by,saying,it,is
very,shockingindeed
and,by,the,means,of,this,continual,though,gentle,vent,was,able
not,only,to,see,the,miss,dashwoods,from,the,first,without,the
smallest,emotion,but,very,soon,to,see,them,without,recollecting,a,word
of,the,matter,and,having,thus,supported,the,dignity,of,her,own
sex,and,spoken,her,decided,censure,of,what,was,wrong,in,the
other,she,thought,herself,at,liberty,to,attend,to,the,interest,of
her,own,assemblies,and,therefore,determined,though,rather,against,the,opinion,of
sir,john,that,as,mrs,willoughby,would,at,once,be,a,woman
of,elegance,and,fortune,to,leave,her,card,with,her,as,soon
as,shemarried
colonel,brandon,s,delicate,unobtrusive,enquiries,were,never,unwelcome,to,missdashwood
he,had,abundantly,earned,the,privilege,of,intimate,discussion,of,her,sister
s,disappointment,by,the,friendly,zeal,with,which,he,had,endeavoured,to
soften,it,and,they,always,conversed,withconfidence
his,chief,reward,for,the,painful,exertion,of,disclosing,past,sorrows,and
present,humiliations,was,given,in,the,pitying,eye,with,which,marianne,sometimes
observed,him,and,the,gentleness,of,her,voice,whenever,though,it,did
not,often,happen,she,was,obliged,or,could,oblige,herself,to,speak
tohim
_these_,assured,him,that,his,exertion,had,produced,an,increase,of,good
will,towards,himself,and,_these_,gave,elinor,hopes,of,its,being,farther
augmented,hereafter,but,mrs,jennings,who,knew,nothing,of,all,this,who
knew,only,that,the,colonel,continued,as,grave,as,ever,and,that
she,could,neither,prevail,on,him,to,make,the,offer,himself,nor
commission,her,to,make,it,for,him,began,at,the,end,of
two,days,to,think,that,instead,of,mid,summer,they,would,not
be,married,till,michaelmas,and,by,the,end,of,a,week,that
it,would,not,be,a,match,atall
the,good,understanding,between,the,colonel,and,miss,dashwood,seemed,rather,to
declare,that,the,honours,of,the,mulberry,tree,the,canal,and,the
yew,arbour,would,all,be,made,over,to,_her_,and,mrs,jennings
had,for,some,time,ceased,to,think,at,all,of,mrsferrars

letter,elinor,had,the,painful,office,of,informing,her,sister,that,he
wasmarried
she,had,taken,care,to,have,the,intelligence,conveyed,to,herself,as
soon,as,it,was,known,that,the,ceremony,was,over,as,she
was,desirous,that,marianne,should,not,receive,the,first,notice,of,it
from,the,public,papers,which,she,saw,her,eagerly,examining,everymorning
she,received,the,news,with,resolute,composure,made,no,observation,on,it
and,at,first,shed,no,tears,but,after,a,short,time,they
would,burst,out,and,for,the,rest,of,the,day,she,was
in,a,state,hardly,less,pitiable,than,when,she,first,learnt,to
expect,theevent
the,willoughbys,left,town,as,soon,as,they,were,married,and,elinor
now,hoped,as,there,could,be,no,danger,of,her,seeing,either

a,lady,at,the,other,end,of,the,street,on,whom,she

to,tend,to,their,orders,and,they,were,obliged,towait
all,that,could,be,done,was,to,sit,down,at,that,end
of,the,counter,which,seemed,to,promise,the,quickest,succession,one,gentleman
only,was,standing,there,and,it,is,probable,that,elinor,was,not
without,hope,of,exciting,his,politeness,to,a,quickerdespatch
but,the,correctness,of,his,eye,and,the,delicacy,of,his,taste
proved,to,be,beyond,hispoliteness

a,sort,of,claim,on,her,future,consideration,which,a,conscientious,woman

elinor,tried,very,seriously,to,convince,him,that,there,was,no,likelihood
of,her,marrying,colonel,brandon,but,it,was,an,expectation,of,too
much,pleasure,to,himself,to,be,relinquished,and,he,was,really,resolved
on,seeking,an,intimacy,with,that,gentleman,and,promoting,the,marriage,by
every,possibleattention
he,had,just,compunction,enough,for,having,done,nothing,for,his,sisters
himself,to,be,exceedingly,anxious,that,everybody,else,should,do,a,great
deal,and,an,offer,from,colonel,brandon,or,a,legacy,from,mrs

your,sister,need,not,have,any,scruple,even,of,visiting,_her_,which
to,say,the,truth,has,been,a,little,the,case,and,very
naturally,for,we,only,knew,that,mrs,jennings,was,the,widow,of
a,man,who,had,got,all,his,money,in,a,low,way
and,fanny,and,mrs,ferrars,were,both,strongly,prepossessed,that,neither,she
nor,her,daughters,were,such,kind,of,women,as,fanny,would,like
to,associatewith
but,now,i,can,carry,her,a,most,satisfactory,account,ofboth
chapter,xxxiv,mrs,john,dashwood,had,so,much,confidence,in,her,husband
s,judgment,that,she,waited,the,very,next,day,both,on,mrs
jennings,and,her,daughter,and,her,confidence,was,rewarded,by,finding,even
the,former,even,the,woman,with,whom,her,sisters,were,staying,by
no,means,unworthy,her,notice,and,as,for,lady,middleton,she,found
her,one,of,the,most,charming,women,in,theworld
lady,middleton,was,equally,pleased,with,mrsdashwood
there,was,a,kind,of,cold,hearted,selfishness,on,both,sides,which
mutually,attracted,them,and,they,sympathised,with,each,other,in,an,insipid
propriety,of,demeanor,and,a,general,want,ofunderstanding
the,same,manners,however,which,recommended,mrs,john,dashwood,to,the,good
opinion,of,lady,middleton,did,not,suit,the,fancy,of,mrs,jennings
and,to,_her_,she,appeared,nothing,more,than,a,little,proud,looking
woman,of,uncordial,address,who,met,her,husband,s,sisters,without,any
affection,and,almost,without,having,anything,to,say,to,them,for,of
the,quarter,of,an,hour,bestowed,on,berkeley,street,she,sat,at
least,seven,minutes,and,a,half,insilence
elinor,wanted,very,much,to,know,though,she,did,not,choose,to
ask,whether,edward,was,then,in,town,but,nothing,would,have,induced
fanny,voluntarily,to,mention,his,name,before,her,till,able,to,tell
her,that,his,marriage,with,miss,morton,was,resolved,on,or,till
her,husband,s,expectations,on,colonel,brandon,were,answered,because,she,believed
them,still,so,very,much,attached,to,each,other,that,they,could
not,be,too,sedulously,divided,in,word,and,deed,on,everyoccasion
the,intelligence,however,which,_she_,would,not,give,soon,flowed,from,another
quarter

to,see,edward,though,he,had,arrived,in,town,with,mr,and
mrsdashwood
he,dared,not,come,to,bartlett,s,buildings,for,fear,of,detection

short,time,by,twice,calling,in,berkeleystreet

their,morning,sengagements
elinor,was,pleased,that,he,had,called,and,still,more,pleased,that
she,had,missedhim
the,dashwoods,were,so,prodigiously,delighted,with,the,middletons,that,though,not
much,in,the,habit,of,giving,anything,they,determined,to,give,them
a,dinner,and,soon,after,their,acquaintance,began,invited,them,to,dine
in,harley,street,where,they,had,taken,a,very,good,house,for
threemonths
their,sisters,and,mrs,jennings,were,invited,likewise,and,john,dashwood,was
careful,to,secure,colonel,brandon,who,always,glad,to,be,where,the
miss,dashwoods,were,received,his,eager,civilities,with,some,surprise,but,much
morepleasure
they,were,to,meet,mrs,ferrars,but,elinor,could,not,learn,whether
her,sons,were,to,be,of,theparty
the,expectation,of,seeing,_her_,however,was,enough,to,make,her,interested
in,the,engagement,for,though,she,could,now,meet,edward,s,mother
without,that,strong,anxiety,which,had,once,promised,to,attend,such,an
introduction,though,she,could,now,see,her,with,perfect,indifference,as,to
her,opinion,of,herself,her,desire,of,being,in,company,with,mrs
ferrars,her,curiosity,to,know,what,she,was,like,was,as,lively
asever
the,interest,with,which,she,thus,anticipated,the,party,was,soon,afterwards
increased,more,powerfully,than,pleasantly,by,her,hearing,that,the,miss,steeles
were,also,to,be,atit
so,well,had,they,recommended,themselves,to,lady,middleton,so,agreeable,had
their,assiduities,made,them,to,her,that,though,lucy,was,certainly,not
so,elegant,and,her,sister,not,even,genteel,she,was,as,ready
as,sir,john,to,ask,them,to,spend,a,week,or,two
in,conduit,street,and,it,happened,to,be,particularly,convenient,to,the
miss,steeles,as,soon,as,the,dashwoods,invitation,was,known,that,their
visit,should,begin,a,few,days,before,the,party,tookplace
their,claims,to,the,notice,of,mrs,john,dashwood,as,the,nieces
of,the,gentleman,who,for,many,years,had,had,the,care,of
her,brother,might,not,have,done,much,however,towards,procuring,them,seats
at,her,table,but,as,lady,middleton,s,guests,they,must,be
welcome,and,lucy,who,had,long,wanted,to,be,personally,known,to
the,family,to,have,a,nearer,view,of,their,characters,and,her
own,difficulties,and,to,have,an,opportunity,of,endeavouring,to,please,them
had,seldom,been,happier,in,her,life,than,she,was,on,receiving
mrs,john,dashwood,scard
on,elinor,its,effect,was,verydifferent
she,began,immediately,to,determine,that,edward,who,lived,with,his,mother
must,be,asked,as,his,mother,was,to,a,party,given,by
his,sister,and,to,see,him,for,the,first,time,after,all
that,passed,in,the,company,of,lucy,she,hardly,knew,how,she
could,bearit
these,apprehensions,perhaps,were,not,founded,entirely,on,reason,and,certainly,not
at,all,ontruth
they,were,relieved,however,not,by,her,own,recollection,but,by,the
good,will,of,lucy,who,believed,herself,to,be,inflicting,a,severe
disappointment,when,she,told,her,that,edward,certainly,would,not,be,in
harley,street,on,tuesday,and,even,hoped,to,be,carrying,the,pain
still,farther,by,persuading,her,that,he,was,kept,away,by,the
extreme,affection,for,herself,which,he,could,not,conceal,when,they,were
together

to,this,formidable,mother,inlaw

its,being,miss,morton,s,mother,rather,than,her,own,whom,they
were,about,to,behold,but,instead,of,doing,that,she,assured,her
and,with,great,sincerity,that,she,did,pity,her,to,the,utter
amazement,of,lucy,who,though,really,uncomfortable,herself,hoped,at,least,to
be,an,object,of,irrepressible,envy,toelinor
mrs,ferrars,was,a,little,thin,woman,upright,even,to,formality,in
her,figure,and,serious,even,to,sourness,in,heraspect
her,complexion,was,sallow,and,her,features,small,without,beauty,and,naturally
without,expression,but,a,lucky,contraction,of,the,brow,had,rescued,her
countenance,from,the,disgrace,of,insipidity,by,giving,it,the,strong,characters
of,pride,and,illnature
she,was,not,a,woman,of,many,words,for,unlike,people,in
general,she,proportioned,them,to,the,number,of,her,ideas,and,of
the,few,syllables,that,did,escape,her,not,one,fell,to,the
share,of,miss,dashwood,whom,she,eyed,with,the,spirited,determination,of
disliking,her,at,allevents
elinor,could,not,_now_,be,made,unhappy,by,thisbehaviour
a,few,months,ago,it,would,have,hurt,her,exceedingly,but,it
was,not,in,mrs,ferrars,power,to,distress,her,by,it,now
and,the,difference,of,her,manners,to,the,miss,steeles,a,difference
which,seemed,purposely,made,to,humble,her,more,only,amusedher

and,daughter,towards,the,very,person,for,lucy,was,particularly,distinguished,whom
of,all,others,had,they,known,as,much,as,she,did,they

comparatively,no,power,to,wound,them,sat,pointedly,slighted,byboth

reflect,on,the,mean,spirited,folly,from,which,it,sprung,nor,observe
the,studied,attentions,with,which,the,miss,steeles,courted,its,continuance,without
thoroughly,despising,them,allfour

infer,from,it,no,poverty,of,any,kind,except,of,conversation,appeared
but,there,the,deficiency,wasconsiderable
john,dashwood,had,not,much,to,say,for,himself,that,was,worth
hearing,and,his,wife,had,stillless
but,there,was,no,peculiar,disgrace,in,this,for,it,was,very
much,the,case,with,the,chief,of,their,visitors,who,almost,all
laboured,under,one,or,other,of,these,disqualifications,for,being,agreeable,want
of,sense,either,natural,or,improved,want,of,elegance,want,of,spirits
or,want,oftemper

variety,the,variety,of,politics,inclosing,land,and,breaking,horses,but,then
it,was,all,over,and,one,subject,only,engaged,the,ladies,till

age

too,easily,by,measuring,them,at,once,but,as,harry,only,was
present,it,was,all,conjectural,assertion,on,both,sides,and,every,body
had,a,right,to,be,equally,positive,in,their,opinion,and,to
repeat,it,over,and,over,again,as,often,as,theyliked

elinor,wished,to,talk,of,something,else,but,lucy,still,pressed,her
to,own,that,she,had,reason,for,her,happiness,and,elinor,was
obliged,to,goon
undoubtedly,if,they,had,known,your,engagement,said,she,nothing,could,be
more,flattering,than,their,treatment,of,you,but,as,that,was,not
the,case,i,guessed,you,would,say,so,replied,lucy,quickly,but
there,was,no,reason,in,the,world,why,mrs,ferrars,should,seem
to,like,me,if,she,did,not,and,her,liking,me,is
everything

_should_,tell,hersister
lucycontinued
i,am,sure,i,should,have,seen,it,in,a,moment,if
mrs,ferrars,had,took,a,dislike,tome
if,she,had,only,made,me,a,formal,courtesy,for,instance,without
saying,a,word,and,never,after,had,took,any,notice,of,me
and,never,looked,at,me,in,a,pleasant,way,you,know,what

elinor,was,prevented,from,making,any,reply,to,this,civil,triumph,by
the,door,s,being,thrown,open,the,servant,s,announcing,mr,ferrars
and,edward,s,immediately,walkingin
it,was,a,very,awkward,moment,and,the,countenance,of,each,showed
that,it,wasso
they,all,looked,exceedingly,foolish,and,edward,seemed,to,have,as,great
an,inclination,to,walk,out,of,the,room,again,as,to,advance
farther,intoit
the,very,circumstance,in,its,unpleasantest,form,which,they,would,each,have
been,most,anxious,to,avoid,had,fallen,onthem
they,were,not,only,all,three,together,but,were,together,without,the
relief,of,any,otherperson
the,ladies,recovered,themselvesfirst
it,was,not,lucy,s,business,to,put,herself,forward,and,the
appearance,of,secrecy,must,still,be,keptup
she,could,therefore,only,_look_,her,tenderness,and,after,slightly,addressing,him
said,nomore
but,elinor,had,more,to,do,and,so,anxious,was,she,for
his,sake,and,her,own,to,do,it,well,that,she,forced
herself,after,a,moment,s,recollection,to,welcome,him,with,a,look
and,manner,that,were,almost,easy,and,almost,open,and,another,struggle
another,effort,still,improvedthem
she,would,not,allow,the,presence,of,lucy,nor,the,consciousness,of
some,injustice,towards,herself,to,deter,her,from,saying,that,she,was
happy,to,see,him,and,that,she,had,very,much,regretted,being
from,home,when,he,called,before,in,berkeleystreet
she,would,not,be,frightened,from,paying,him,those,attentions,which,as
a,friend,and,almost,a,relation,were,his,due,by,the,observant
eyes,of,lucy,though,she,soon,perceived,them,to,be,narrowly,watching
her
her,manners,gave,some,re,assurance,to,edward,and,he,had,courage
enough,to,sit,down,but,his,embarrassment,still,exceeded,that,of,the
ladies,in,a,proportion,which,the,case,rendered,reasonable,though,his,sex
might,make,it,rare,for,his,heart,had,not,the,indifference,of
lucy,s,nor,could,his,conscience,have,quite,the,ease,of,elinor
s
lucy,with,a,demure,and,settled,air,seemed,determined,to,make,no
contribution,to,the,comfort,of,the,others,and,would,not,say,a
word,and,almost,every,thing,that,_was_,said,proceeded,from,elinor,who
was,obliged,to,volunteer,all,the,information,about,her,mother,s,health
their,coming,to,town,c,which,edward,ought,to,have,inquired,about
but,neverdid
her,exertions,did,not,stop,here,for,she,soon,afterwards,felt,herself
so,heroically,disposed,as,to,determine,under,pretence,of,fetching,marianne,to
leave,the,others,by,themselves,and,she,really,did,it,and,_that_
in,the,handsomest,manner,for,she,loitered,away,several,minutes,on,the
landing,place,with,the,most,high,minded,fortitude,before,she,went,to
hersister
when,that,was,once,done,however,it,was,time,for,the,raptures
of,edward,to,cease,for,marianne,s,joy,hurried,her,into,the
drawing,roomimmediately
her,pleasure,in,seeing,him,was,like,every,other,of,her,feelings
strong,in,itself,and,stronglyspoken
she,met,him,with,a,hand,that,would,be,taken,and,a
voice,that,expressed,the,affection,of,asister
dearedward
she,cried,this,is,a,moment,of,great,happiness,this,would,almost
make,amends,for,everything
edward,tried,to,return,her,kindness,as,it,deserved,but,before,such
witnesses,he,dared,not,say,half,what,he,reallyfelt
again,they,all,sat,down,and,for,a,moment,or,two,all
were,silent,while,marianne,was,looking,with,the,most,speaking,tenderness,sometimes
at,edward,and,sometimes,at,elinor,regretting,only,that,their,delight,in
each,other,should,be,checked,by,lucy,s,unwelcomepresence
edward,was,the,first,to,speak,and,it,was,to,notice,marianne
s,altered,looks,and,express,his,fear,of,her,not,finding,london
agree,withher
oh,don,t,think,ofme
she,replied,with,spirited,earnestness,though,her,eyes,were,filled,with,tears
as,she,spoke,don,t,think,of,_my_health
elinor,is,well,yousee
that,must,be,enough,for,usboth
this,remark,was,not,calculated,to,make,edward,or,elinor,more,easy
nor,to,conciliate,the,good,will,of,lucy,who,looked,up,at
marianne,with,no,very,benignantexpression
do,you,likelondon
said,edward,willing,to,say,any,thing,that,might,introduce,anothersubject
not,atall
i,expected,much,pleasure,in,it,but,i,have,foundnone
the,sight,of,you,edward,is,the,only,comfort,it,has,afforded
and,thankheaven
you,are,what,you,alwayswere
she,paused,no,onespoke
i,think,elinor,she,presently,added,we,must,employ,edward,to,take
care,of,us,in,our,return,tobarton
in,a,week,or,two,i,suppose,we,shall,be,going,and
i,trust,edward,will,not,be,very,unwilling,to,accept,thecharge
poor,edward,muttered,something,but,what,it,was,nobody,knew,not,even
himself
but,marianne,who,saw,his,agitation,and,could,easily,trace,it,to
whatever,cause,best,pleased,herself,was,perfectly,satisfied,and,soon,talked,of
somethingelse
we,spent,such,a,day,edward,in,harley,streetyesterday
so,dull,so,wretchedly,dull,but,i,have,much,to,say,to
you,on,that,head,which,cannot,be,saidnow
and,with,this,admirable,discretion,did,she,defer,the,assurance,of,her
finding,their,mutual,relatives,more,disagreeable,than,ever,and,of,her,being
particularly,disgusted,with,his,mother,till,they,were,more,inprivate
but,why,were,you,not,there,edward,why,did,you,notcome
i,was,engagedelsewhere
engaged
but,what,was,that,when,such,friends,were,to,bemet
perhaps,miss,marianne,cried,lucy,eager,to,take,some,revenge,on,her
you,think,young,men,never,stand,upon,engagements,if,they,have,no
mind,to,keep,them,little,as,well,asgreat
elinor,was,very,angry,but,marianne,seemed,entirely,insensible,of,the,sting
for,she,calmly,replied,not,so,indeed,for,seriously,speaking,i,am
very,sure,that,conscience,only,kept,edward,from,harleystreet
and,i,really,believe,he,_has_,the,most,delicate,conscience,in,the
world,the,most,scrupulous,in,performing,every,engagement,however,minute,and,however
it,may,make,against,his,interest,orpleasure
he,is,the,most,fearful,of,giving,pain,of,wounding,expectation,and
the,most,incapable,of,being,selfish,of,any,body,i,eversaw
edward,it,is,so,and,i,will,sayit
what
are,you,never,to,hear,yourself,praised,then,you,must,be,no
friend,of,mine,for,those,who,will,accept,of,my,love,and
esteem,must,submit,to,my,opencommendation
the,nature,of,her,commendation,in,the,present,case,however,happened,to
be,particularly,ill,suited,to,the,feelings,of,two,thirds,of,her
auditors,and,was,so,very,unexhilarating,to,edward,that,he,very,soon
got,up,to,goaway
going,sosoon
said,marianne,my,dear,edward,this,must,notbe
and,drawing,him,a,little,aside,she,whispered,her,persuasion,that,lucy
could,not,stay,muchlonger
but,even,this,encouragement,failed,for,he,would,go,and,lucy,who
would,have,outstayed,him,had,his,visit,lasted,two,hours,soon,afterwards
wentaway
what,can,bring,her,here,sooften
said,marianne,on,her,leavingthem
could,not,she,see,that,we,wanted,her,gone,how,teasing,to
edward
why,so,we,were,all,his,friends,and,lucy,has,been,the
longest,known,to,him,ofany
it,is,but,natural,that,he,should,like,to,see,her,as
well,asourselves
marianne,looked,at,her,steadily,and,said,you,know,elinor,that,this
is,a,kind,of,talking,which,i,cannotbear
if,you,only,hope,to,have,your,assertion,contradicted,as,i,must
suppose,to,be,the,case,you,ought,to,recollect,that,i,am
the,last,person,in,the,world,to,doit
i,cannot,descend,to,be,tricked,out,of,assurances,that,are,not
reallywanted
she,then,left,the,room,and,elinor,dared,not,follow,her,to
say,more,for,bound,as,she,was,by,her,promise,of,secrecy
to,lucy,she,could,give,no,information,that,would,convince,marianne,and
painful,as,the,consequences,of,her,still,continuing,in,an,error,might
be,she,was,obliged,to,submit,toit
all,that,she,could,hope,was,that,edward,would,not,often,expose
her,or,himself,to,the,distress,of,hearing,marianne,s,mistaken,warmth
nor,to,the,repetition,of,any,other,part,of,the,pain,that
had,attended,their,recent,meeting,and,this,she,had,every,reason,to
expect
illustration,_drawing,him,a,little,aside,_,chapter,xxxvi,within,a,few
days,after,this,meeting,the,newspapers,announced,to,the,world,that,the
lady,of,thomas,palmeresq
was,safely,delivered,of,a,son,and,heir,a,very,interesting,and
satisfactory,paragraph,at,least,to,all,those,intimate,connections,who,knew,it
before
this,event,highly,important,to,mrs,jennings,s,happiness,produced,a,temporary
alteration,in,the,disposal,of,her,time,and,influenced,in,a,like
degree,the,engagements,of,her,young,friends,for,as,she,wished,to
be,as,much,as,possible,with,charlotte,she,went,thither,every,morning
as,soon,as,she,was,dressed,and,did,not,return,till,late
in,the,evening,and,the,miss,dashwoods,at,the,particular,request,of
the,middletons,spent,the,whole,of,every,day,in,conduitstreet
for,their,own,comfort,they,would,much,rather,have,remained,at,least
all,the,morning,in,mrs,jennings,s,house,but,it,was,not
a,thing,to,be,urged,against,the,wishes,ofeverybody
their,hours,were,therefore,made,over,to,lady,middleton,and,the,two
miss,steeles,by,whom,their,company,in,fact,was,as,little,valued
as,it,was,professedlysought
they,had,too,much,sense,to,be,desirable,companions,to,the,former
and,by,the,latter,they,were,considered,with,a,jealous,eye,as
intruding,on,_their_,ground,and,sharing,the,kindness,which,they,wanted,to
monopolize
though,nothing,could,be,more,polite,than,lady,middleton,s,behaviour,to
elinor,and,marianne,she,did,not,really,like,them,atall
because,they,neither,flattered,herself,nor,her,children,she,could,not,believe
them,good,natured,and,because,they,were,fond,of,reading,she,fancied
them,satirical,perhaps,without,exactly,knowing,what,it,was,to,be,satirical
but,_that_,did,notsignify
it,was,censure,in,common,use,and,easilygiven
their,presence,was,a,restraint,both,on,her,and,onlucy
it,checked,the,idleness,of,one,and,the,business,of,theother
lady,middleton,was,ashamed,of,doing,nothing,before,them,and,the,flattery
which,lucy,was,proud,to,think,of,and,administer,at,other,times
she,feared,they,would,despise,her,foroffering
miss,steele,was,the,least,discomposed,of,the,three,by,their,presence
and,it,was,in,their,power,to,reconcile,her,to,itentirely
would,either,of,them,only,have,given,her,a,full,and,minute
account,of,the,whole,affair,between,marianne,and,mr,willoughby,she,would
have,thought,herself,amply,rewarded,for,the,sacrifice,of,the,best,place
by,the,fire,after,dinner,which,their,arrivaloccasioned
but,this,conciliation,was,not,granted,for,though,she,often,threw,out
expressions,of,pity,for,her,sister,to,elinor,and,more,than,once
dropt,a,reflection,on,the,inconstancy,of,beaux,before,marianne,no,effect
was,produced,but,a,look,of,indifference,from,the,former,or,of
disgust,in,thelatter
an,effort,even,yet,lighter,might,have,made,her,theirfriend
would,they,only,have,laughed,at,her,about,thedoctor
but,so,little,were,they,anymore,than,the,others,inclined,to,oblige
her,that,if,sir,john,dined,from,home,she,might,spend,a
whole,day,without,hearing,any,other,raillery,on,the,subject,than,what
she,was,kind,enough,to,bestow,onherself
all,these,jealousies,and,discontents,however,were,so,totally,unsuspected,by,mrs
jennings,that,she,thought,it,a,delightful,thing,for,the,girls,to
be,together,and,generally,congratulated,her,young,friends,every,night,on,having
escaped,the,company,of,a,stupid,old,woman,solong
she,joined,them,sometimes,at,sir,john,s,sometimes,at,her,own
house,but,wherever,it,was,she,always,came,in,excellent,spirits,full
of,delight,and,importance,attributing,charlotte,s,well,doing,to,her,own
care,and,ready,to,give,so,exact,so,minute,a,detail,of
her,situation,as,only,miss,steele,had,curiosity,enough,todesire
one,thing,_did_,disturb,her,and,of,that,she,made,her,daily
complaint
mr,palmer,maintained,the,common,but,unfatherly,opinion,among,his,sex,of
all,infants,being,alike,and,though,she,could,plainly,perceive,at,different
times,the,most,striking,resemblance,between,this,baby,and,every,one,of
his,relations,on,both,sides,there,was,no,convincing,his,father,of
it,no,persuading,him,to,believe,that,it,was,not,exactly,like
every,other,baby,of,the,same,age,nor,could,he,even,be
brought,to,acknowledge,the,simple,proposition,of,its,being,the,finest,child
in,theworld
i,come,now,to,the,relation,of,a,misfortune,which,about,this
time,befell,mrs,johndashwood
it,so,happened,that,while,her,two,sisters,with,mrs,jennings,were
first,calling,on,her,in,harley,street,another,of,her,acquaintance,had
dropt,in,a,circumstance,in,itself,not,apparently,likely,to,produce,evil
toher
but,while,the,imaginations,of,other,people,will,carry,them,away,to
form,wrong,judgments,of,our,conduct,and,to,decide,on,it,by
slight,appearances,one,s,happiness,must,in,some,measure,be,always,at
the,mercy,ofchance
in,the,present,instance,this,last,arrived,lady,allowed,her,fancy,to
so,far,outrun,truth,and,probability,that,on,merely,hearing,the,name
of,the,miss,dashwoods,and,understanding,them,to,be,mr,dashwood,s
sisters,she,immediately,concluded,them,to,be,staying,in,harley,street,and
this,misconstruction,produced,within,a,day,or,two,afterwards,cards,of,invitation
for,them,as,well,as,for,their,brother,and,sister,to,a
small,musical,party,at,herhouse
the,consequence,of,which,was,that,mrs,john,dashwood,was,obliged,to
submit,not,only,to,the,exceedingly,great,inconvenience,of,sending,her,carriage
for,the,miss,dashwoods,but,what,was,still,worse,must,be,subject
to,all,the,unpleasantness,of,appearing,to,treat,them,with,attention,and
who,could,tell,that,they,might,not,expect,to,go,out,with
her,a,secondtime
the,power,of,disappointing,them,it,was,true,must,always,be,her
s
but,that,was,not,enough,for,when,people,are,determined,on,a
mode,of,conduct,which,they,know,to,be,wrong,they,feel,injured
by,the,expectation,of,any,thing,better,fromthem
marianne,had,now,been,brought,by,degrees,so,much,into,the,habit
of,going,out,every,day,that,it,was,become,a,matter,of
indifference,to,her,whether,she,went,or,not,and,she,prepared,quietly
and,mechanically,for,every,evening,s,engagement,though,without,expecting,the,smallest
amusement,from,any,and,very,often,without,knowing,till,the,last,moment
where,it,was,to,takeher
to,her,dress,and,appearance,she,was,grown,so,perfectly,indifferent,as
not,to,bestow,half,the,consideration,on,it,during,the,whole,of
her,toilet,which,it,received,from,miss,steele,in,the,first,five
minutes,of,their,being,together,when,it,wasfinished
nothing,escaped,_her_,minute,observation,and,general,curiosity,she,saw,every,thing
and,asked,every,thing,was,never,easy,till,she,knew,the,price
of,every,part,of,marianne,s,dress,could,have,guessed,the,number
of,her,gowns,altogether,with,better,judgment,than,marianne,herself,and,was
not,without,hopes,of,finding,out,before,they,parted,how,much,her
washing,cost,per,week,and,how,much,she,had,every,year,to
spend,uponherself
the,impertinence,of,these,kind,of,scrutinies,moreover,was,generally,concluded,with
a,compliment,which,though,meant,as,its,douceur,was,considered,by,marianne
as,the,greatest,impertinence,of,all,for,after,undergoing,an,examination,into
the,value,and,make,of,her,gown,the,colour,of,her,shoes
and,the,arrangement,of,her,hair,she,was,almost,sure,of,being
told,that,upon,her,word,she,looked,vastly,smart,and,she,dared
to,say,she,would,make,a,great,manyconquests
with,such,encouragement,as,this,was,she,dismissed,on,the,present,occasion
to,her,brother,s,carriage,which,they,were,ready,to,enter,five
minutes,after,it,stopped,at,the,door,a,punctuality,not,very,agreeable
to,their,sister,in,law,who,had,preceded,them,to,the,house
of,her,acquaintance,and,was,there,hoping,for,some,delay,on,their
part,that,might,inconvenience,either,herself,or,hercoachman
the,events,of,this,evening,were,not,veryremarkable
the,party,like,other,musical,parties,comprehended,a,great,many,people,who
had,real,taste,for,the,performance,and,a,great,many,more,who
had,none,at,all,and,the,performers,themselves,were,as,usual,in
their,own,estimation,and,that,of,their,immediate,friends,the,first,private
performers,inengland
as,elinor,was,neither,musical,nor,affecting,to,be,so,she,made
no,scruple,of,turning,her,eyes,from,the,grand,pianoforte,whenever,it
suited,her,and,unrestrained,even,by,the,presence,of,a,harp,and
violoncello,would,fix,them,at,pleasure,on,any,other,object,in,the
room
in,one,of,these,excursive,glances,she,perceived,among,a,group,of
young,men,the,very,he,who,had,given,them,a,lecture,on
toothpick,cases,at,grays
she,perceived,him,soon,afterwards,looking,at,herself,and,speaking,familiarly,to
her,brother,and,had,just,determined,to,find,out,his,name,from
the,latter,when,they,both,came,towards,her,and,mr,dashwood,introduced
him,to,her,as,mr,robertferrars
he,addressed,her,with,easy,civility,and,twisted,his,head,into,a
bow,which,assured,her,as,plainly,as,words,could,have,done,that
he,was,exactly,the,coxcomb,she,had,heard,him,described,to,be
bylucy
happy,had,it,been,for,her,if,her,regard,for,edward,had
depended,less,on,his,own,merit,than,on,the,merit,of,his
nearestrelations
for,then,his,brother,s,bow,must,have,given,the,finishing,stroke
to,what,the,ill,humour,of,his,mother,and,sister,would,have
begun
but,while,she,wondered,at,the,difference,of,the,two,young,men
she,did,not,find,that,the,emptiness,of,conceit,of,the,one
put,her,out,of,all,charity,with,the,modesty,and,worth,of
theother
why,they,_were_,different,robert,exclaimed,to,her,himself,in,the,course
of,a,quarter,of,an,hour,s,conversation,for,talking,of,his
brother,and,lamenting,the,extreme,_gaucherie_,which,he,really,believed,kept,him
from,mixing,in,proper,society,he,candidly,and,generously,attributed,it,much
less,to,any,natural,deficiency,than,to,the,misfortune,of,a,private
education,while,he,himself,though,probably,without,any,particular,any,material,superiority
by,nature,merely,from,the,advantage,of,a,public,school,was,as
well,fitted,to,mix,in,the,world,as,any,otherman
upon,my,soul,he,added,i,believe,it,is,nothing,more,and
so,i,often,tell,my,mother,when,she,is,grieving,aboutit
my,dear,madam,i,always,say,to,her,you,must,make,yourself
easy
the,evil,is,now,irremediable,and,it,has,been,entirely,your,own
doing
why,would,you,be,persuaded,by,my,uncle,sir,robert,against,your
own,judgment,to,place,edward,under,private,tuition,at,the,most,critical
time,of,hislife
if,you,had,only,sent,him,to,westminster,as,well,as,myself
instead,of,sending,him,to,mr,pratt,s,all,this,would,have
beenprevented
this,is,the,way,in,which,i,always,consider,the,matter,and
my,mother,is,perfectly,convinced,of,hererror
elinor,would,not,oppose,his,opinion,because,whatever,might,be,her,general
estimation,of,the,advantage,of,a,public,school,she,could,not,think
of,edward,s,abode,in,mr,pratt,s,family,with,anysatisfaction
you,reside,in,devonshire,i,think,was,his,next,observation,in,a
cottage,neardawlish
elinor,set,him,right,as,to,its,situation,and,it,seemed,rather
surprising,to,him,that,anybody,could,live,in,devonshire,without,living,near
dawlish
he,bestowed,his,hearty,approbation,however,on,their,species,ofhouse
for,my,own,part,said,he,i,am,excessively,fond,of,a
cottage,there,is,always,so,much,comfort,so,much,elegance,aboutthem
and,i,protest,if,i,had,any,money,to,spare,i,should
buy,a,little,land,and,build,one,myself,within,a,short,distance
of,london,where,i,might,drive,myself,down,at,any,time,and
collect,a,few,friends,about,me,and,behappy
i,advise,every,body,who,is,going,to,build,to,build,a
cottage
my,friend,lord,courtland,came,to,me,the,other,day,on,purpose
to,ask,my,advice,and,laid,before,me,three,different,plans,of
bonomis
i,was,to,decide,on,the,best,ofthem
my,dear,courtland,said,i,immediately,throwing,them,all,into,the,fire
do,not,adopt,either,of,them,but,by,all,means,build,a
cottage
and,that,i,fancy,will,be,the,end,ofit
some,people,imagine,that,there,can,be,no,accommodations,no,space,in
a,cottage,but,this,is,all,amistake
i,was,last,month,at,my,friend,elliott,s,neardartford
lady,elliott,wished,to,give,adance
but,how,can,it,bedone
said,she,my,dear,ferrars,do,tell,me,how,it,is,to
bemanaged
there,is,not,a,room,in,this,cottage,that,will,hold,ten
couple,and,where,can,the,supperbe
i,immediately,saw,that,there,could,be,no,difficulty,in,it,so
i,said,my,dear,lady,elliott,do,not,beuneasy
the,dining,parlour,will,admit,eighteen,couple,with,ease,card,tables,may
be,placed,in,the,drawing,room,the,library,may,be,open,for
tea,and,other,refreshments,and,let,the,supper,be,set,out,in
thesaloon
lady,elliott,was,delighted,with,thethought
we,measured,the,dining,room,and,found,it,would,hold,exactly,eighteen
couple,and,the,affair,was,arranged,precisely,after,myplan
so,that,in,fact,you,see,if,people,do,but,know,how
to,set,about,it,every,comfort,may,be,as,well,enjoyed,in
a,cottage,as,in,the,most,spaciousdwelling
elinor,agreed,to,it,all,for,she,did,not,think,he,deserved
the,compliment,of,rationalopposition
as,john,dashwood,had,no,more,pleasure,in,music,than,his,eldest
sister,his,mind,was,equally,at,liberty,to,fix,on,any,thing
else,and,a,thought,struck,him,during,the,evening,which,he,communicated
to,his,wife,for,her,approbation,when,they,gothome
the,consideration,of,mrs,dennison,s,mistake,in,supposing,his,sisters,their
guests,had,suggested,the,propriety,of,their,being,really,invited,to,become
such,while,mrs,jennings,s,engagements,kept,her,fromhome
the,expense,would,be,nothing,the,inconvenience,not,more,and,it,was
altogether,an,attention,which,the,delicacy,of,his,conscience,pointed,out,to
be,requisite,to,its,complete,enfranchisement,from,his,promise,to,hisfather
fanny,was,startled,at,theproposal
i,do,not,see,how,it,can,be,done,said,she,without
affronting,lady,middleton,for,they,spend,every,day,with,her,otherwise,i
should,be,exceedingly,glad,to,doit
you,know,i,am,always,ready,to,pay,them,any,attention,in
my,power,as,my,taking,them,out,this,eveningshows
but,they,are,lady,middleton,svisitors
how,can,i,ask,them,away,fromher
her,husband,but,with,great,humility,did,not,see,the,force,of
herobjection
they,had,already,spent,a,week,in,this,manner,in,conduit,street
and,lady,middleton,could,not,be,displeased,at,their,giving,the,same
number,of,days,to,such,nearrelations
fanny,paused,a,moment,and,then,with,fresh,vigor,said,my,love
i,would,ask,them,with,all,my,heart,if,it,was,in
mypower
but,i,had,just,settled,within,myself,to,ask,the,miss,steeles
to,spend,a,few,days,withus
they,are,very,well,behaved,good,kind,of,girls,and,i,think
the,attention,is,due,to,them,as,their,uncle,did,so,very
well,byedward
we,can,ask,your,sisters,some,other,year,you,know,but,the
miss,steeles,may,not,be,in,town,anymore
i,am,sure,you,will,like,them,indeed,you,_do_,like,them
you,know,very,much,already,and,so,does,my,mother,and,they
are,such,favourites,withharry
mr,dashwood,wasconvinced
he,saw,the,necessity,of,inviting,the,miss,steeles,immediately,and,his
conscience,was,pacified,by,the,resolution,of,inviting,his,sisters,another,year
at,the,same,time,however,slyly,suspecting,that,another,year,would,make
the,invitation,needless,by,bringing,elinor,to,town,as,colonel,brandon,s
wife,and,marianne,as,_their_visitor
fanny,rejoicing,in,her,escape,and,proud,of,the,ready,wit,that
had,procured,it,wrote,the,next,morning,to,lucy,to,request,her
company,and,her,sister,s,for,some,days,in,harley,street,as
soon,as,lady,middleton,could,sparethem
this,was,enough,to,make,lucy,really,and,reasonablyhappy
mrs,dashwood,seemed,actually,working,for,her,herself,cherishing,all,her,hopes
and,promoting,all,herviews
such,an,opportunity,of,being,with,edward,and,his,family,was,above
all,things,the,most,material,to,her,interest,and,such,an,invitation
the,most,gratifying,to,herfeelings
it,was,an,advantage,that,could,not,be,too,gratefully,acknowledged,nor
too,speedily,made,use,of,and,the,visit,to,lady,middleton,which
had,not,before,had,any,precise,limits,was,instantly,discovered,to,have
been,always,meant,to,end,in,two,daystime
when,the,note,was,shown,to,elinor,as,it,was,within,ten
minutes,after,its,arrival,it,gave,her,for,the,first,time,some
share,in,the,expectations,of,lucy,for,such,a,mark,of,uncommon
kindness,vouchsafed,on,so,short,an,acquaintance,seemed,to,declare,that,the
good,will,towards,her,arose,from,something,more,than,merely,malice,against
herself,and,might,be,brought,by,time,and,address,to,do,every
thing,that,lucywished
her,flattery,had,already,subdued,the,pride,of,lady,middleton,and,made
an,entry,into,the,close,heart,of,mrs,john,dashwood,and,these
were,effects,that,laid,open,the,probability,ofgreater
the,miss,steeles,removed,to,harley,street,and,all,that,reached,elinor
of,their,influence,there,strengthened,her,expectation,of,theevent
sir,john,who,called,on,them,more,than,once,brought,home,such
accounts,of,the,favour,they,were,in,as,must,be,universallystriking
mrs,dashwood,had,never,been,so,much,pleased,with,any,young,women
in,her,life,as,she,was,with,them,had,given,each,of
them,a,needle,book,made,by,some,emigrant,called,lucy,by,her
christian,name,and,did,not,know,whether,she,should,ever,be,able
to,part,withthem
chapter,xxxvii,mrs,palmer,was,so,well,at,the,end,of,a
fortnight,that,her,mother,felt,it,no,longer,necessary,to,give,up
the,whole,of,her,time,to,her,and,contenting,herself,with,visiting
her,once,or,twice,a,day,returned,from,that,period,to,her
own,home,and,her,own,habits,in,which,she,found,the,miss
dashwoods,very,ready,to,resume,their,formershare
about,the,third,or,fourth,morning,after,their,being,thus,resettled,in
berkeley,street,mrs,jennings,on,returning,from,her,ordinary,visit,to,mrs
palmer,entered,the,drawing,room,where,elinor,was,sitting,by,herself,with
an,air,of,such,hurrying,importance,as,prepared,her,to,hear,something
wonderful,and,giving,her,time,only,to,form,that,idea,began,directly
to,justify,it,by,sayinglord
my,dear,missdashwood
have,you,heard,thenews
no,maam
what,isit
something,sostrange
but,you,shall,hear,itall
when,i,got,to,mr,palmer,s,i,found,charlotte,quite,in
a,fuss,about,thechild
she,was,sure,it,was,very,ill,it,cried,and,fretted,and
was,all,overpimples
so,i,looked,at,it,directly,andlord
my,dear,says,i,it,is,nothing,in,the,world,but,the
red,gum,and,nurse,said,just,thesame
but,charlotte,she,would,not,be,satisfied,so,mr,donavan,was,sent
for,and,luckily,he,happened,to,just,come,in,from,harley,street
so,he,stepped,over,directly,and,as,soon,as,ever,he,saw
the,child,he,said,just,as,we,did,that,it,was,nothing
in,the,world,but,the,red,gum,and,then,charlotte,waseasy
and,so,just,as,he,was,going,away,again,it,came,into
my,head,i,am,sure,i,do,not,know,how,i,happened
to,think,of,it,but,it,came,into,my,head,to,ask
him,if,there,was,anynews
so,upon,that,he,smirked,and,simpered,and,looked,grave,and,seemed
to,know,something,or,other,and,at,last,he,said,in,a
whisper,for,fear,any,unpleasant,report,should,reach,the,young,ladies,under
your,care,as,to,their,sister,s,indisposition,i,think,it,advisable
to,say,that,i,believe,there,is,no,great,reason,for,alarm
i,hope,mrs,dashwood,will,do,verywell
what
is,fannyill
illustration,_in,a,whisper,_,that,is,exactly,what,i,said,my
dear
lord
says,i,is,mrs,dashwoodill
so,then,it,all,came,out,and,the,long,and,the,short
of,the,matter,by,all,i,can,learn,seems,to,bethis
mr,edward,ferrars,the,very,young,man,i,used,to,joke,with
you,about,but,however,as,it,turns,out,i,am,monstrous,glad
there,was,never,any,thing,in,it,mr,edward,ferrars,it,seems
has,been,engaged,above,this,twelvemonth,to,my,cousinlucy
there,s,for,you,mydear
and,not,a,creature,knowing,a,syllable,of,the,matter,exceptnancy
could,you,have,believed,such,a,thingpossible
there,is,no,great,wonder,in,their,liking,one,another,but,that
matters,should,be,brought,so,forward,between,them,and,nobody,suspectit
_that_,isstrange
i,never,happened,to,see,them,together,or,i,am,sure,i
should,have,found,it,outdirectly
well,and,so,this,was,kept,a,great,secret,for,fear,of
mrs,ferrars,and,neither,she,nor,your,brother,or,sister,suspected,a
word,of,the,matter,till,this,very,morning,poor,nancy,who,you
know,is,a,well,meaning,creature,but,no,conjurer,popt,it,all
out
lord
thinks,she,to,herself,they,are,all,so,fond,of,lucy,to
be,sure,they,will,make,no,difficulty,about,it,and,so,away
she,went,to,your,sister,who,was,sitting,all,alone,at,her
carpet,work,little,suspecting,what,was,to,come,for,she,had,just
been,saying,to,your,brother,only,five,minutes,before,that,she,thought
to,make,a,match,between,edward,and,some,lord,s,daughter,or
other,i,forgetwho
so,you,may,think,what,a,blow,it,was,to,all,her
vanity,andpride
she,fell,into,violent,hysterics,immediately,with,such,screams,as,reached,your
brother,s,ears,as,he,was,sitting,in,his,own,dressing,room
down,stairs,thinking,about,writing,a,letter,to,his,steward,in,the
country
so,up,he,flew,directly,and,a,terrible,scene,took,place,for
lucy,was,come,to,them,by,that,time,little,dreaming,what,was
goingon
poorsoul
i,pity,_her,_,and,i,must,say,i,think,she,was
used,very,hardly,for,your,sister,scolded,like,any,fury,and,soon
drove,her,into,a,faintingfit
nancy,she,fell,upon,her,knees,and,cried,bitterly,and,your,brother
he,walked,about,the,room,and,said,he,did,not,know,what
todo
mrs,dashwood,declared,they,should,not,stay,a,minute,longer,in,the
house,and,your,brother,was,forced,to,go,down,upon,_his_,knees
too,to,persuade,her,to,let,them,stay,till,they,had,packed
up,theirclothes
_then_,she,fell,into,hysterics,again,and,he,was,so,frightened,that
he,would,send,for,mr,donavan,and,mr,donavan,found,the,house
in,all,thisuproar
the,carriage,was,at,the,door,ready,to,take,my,poor,cousins
away,and,they,were,just,stepping,in,as,he,came,off,poor
lucy,in,such,a,condition,he,says,she,could,hardly,walk,and
nancy,she,was,almost,asbad
i,declare,i,have,no,patience,with,your,sister,and,i,hope
with,all,my,heart,it,will,be,a,match,in,spite,of
her

what,a,taking,poor,mr,edward,will,be,in,when,he,hears
ofit
to,have,his,love,used,soscornfully
for,they,say,he,is,monstrous,fond,of,her,as,well,he
may
i,should,not,wonder,if,he,was,to,be,in,the,greatest
passion,and,mr,donavan,thinks,just,thesame
he,and,i,had,a,great,deal,of,talk,about,it,and
the,best,of,all,is,that,he,is,gone,back,again,to
harley,street,that,he,may,be,within,call,when,mrs,ferrars,is
told,of,it,for,she,was,sent,for,as,soon,as,ever
my,cousins,left,the,house,for,your,sister,was,sure,_she_,would
be,in,hysterics,too,and,so,she,may,for,what,icare
i,have,no,pity,for,either,ofthem
i,have,no,notion,of,people,s,making,such,a,to,do
about,money,andgreatness
there,is,no,reason,on,earth,why,mr,edward,and,lucy,should
not,marry,for,i,am,sure,mrs,ferrars,may,afford,to,do
very,well,by,her,son,and,though,lucy,has,next,to,nothing
herself,she,knows,better,than,any,body,how,to,make,the,most
of,every,thing,i,dare,say,if,mrs,ferrars,would,only,allow
him,five,hundred,a,year,she,would,make,as,good,an,appearance
with,it,as,any,body,else,would,witheight
lord
how,snug,they,might,live,in,such,another,cottage,as,yours,or
a,little,bigger,with,two,maids,and,two,men,and,i,believe
i,could,help,them,to,a,housemaid,for,my,betty,has,a
sister,out,of,place,that,would,fit,themexactly
here,mrs,jennings,ceased,and,as,elinor,had,had,time,enough,to
collect,her,thoughts,she,was,able,to,give,such,an,answer,and
make,such,observations,as,the,subject,might,naturally,be,supposed,toproduce
happy,to,find,that,she,was,not,suspected,of,any,extraordinary,interest
in,it,that,mrs,jennings,as,she,had,of,late,often,hoped
might,be,the,case,had,ceased,to,imagine,her,at,all,attached
to,edward,and,happy,above,all,the,rest,in,the,absence,of
marianne,she,felt,very,well,able,to,speak,of,the,affair,without
embarrassment,and,to,give,her,judgment,as,she,believed,with,impartiality,on
the,conduct,of,every,one,concerned,init
she,could,hardly,determine,what,her,own,expectation,of,its,event,really
was,though,she,earnestly,tried,to,drive,away,the,notion,of,its
being,possible,to,end,otherwise,at,last,than,in,the,marriage,of
edward,andlucy
what,mrs,ferrars,would,say,and,do,though,there,could,not,be
a,doubt,of,its,nature,she,was,anxious,to,hear,and,still
more,anxious,to,know,how,edward,would,conducthimself
for,_him_,she,felt,much,compassion,for,lucy,very,little,and,it
cost,her,some,pains,to,procure,that,little,for,the,rest,of
the,party,none,atall
as,mrs,jennings,could,talk,on,no,other,subject,elinor,soon,saw
the,necessity,of,preparing,marianne,for,itsdiscussion
no,time,was,to,be,lost,in,undeceiving,her,in,making,her
acquainted,with,the,real,truth,and,in,endeavouring,to,bring,her,to
hear,it,talked,of,by,others,without,betraying,that,she,felt,any
uneasiness,for,her,sister,or,any,resentment,againstedward
elinor,s,office,was,a,painfulone
she,was,going,to,remove,what,she,really,believed,to,be,her
sister,s,chief,consolation,to,give,such,particulars,of,edward,as,she
feared,would,ruin,him,for,ever,in,her,good,opinion,and,to
make,marianne,by,a,resemblance,in,their,situations,which,to,_her_,fancy
would,seem,strong,feel,all,her,own,disappointment,overagain
but,unwelcome,as,such,a,task,must,be,it,was,necessary,to
be,done,and,elinor,therefore,hastened,to,performit
she,was,very,far,from,wishing,to,dwell,on,her,own,feelings
or,to,represent,herself,as,suffering,much,any,otherwise,than,as,the
self,command,she,had,practised,since,her,first,knowledge,of,edward,s
engagement,might,suggest,a,hint,of,what,was,practicable,tomarianne
her,narration,was,clear,and,simple,and,though,it,could,not,be
given,without,emotion,it,was,not,accompanied,by,violent,agitation,nor,impetuous
grief
_that_,belonged,rather,to,the,hearer,for,marianne,listened,with,horror,and
criedexcessively
elinor,was,to,be,the,comforter,of,others,in,her,own,distresses
no,less,than,in,theirs,and,all,the,comfort,that,could,be
given,by,assurances,of,her,own,composure,of,mind,and,a,very
earnest,vindication,of,edward,from,every,charge,but,of,imprudence,was,readily
offered
but,marianne,for,some,time,would,give,credit,toneither

_had_,loved,him,most,sincerely,could,she,feel,less,thanherself
as,for,lucy,steele,she,considered,her,so,totally,unamiable,so,absolutely
incapable,of,attaching,a,sensible,man,that,she,could,not,be,persuaded
at,first,to,believe,and,afterwards,to,pardon,any,former,affection,of
edward,forher
she,would,not,even,admit,it,to,have,been,natural,and,elinor
left,her,to,be,convinced,that,it,was,so,by,that,which
only,could,convince,her,a,better,knowledge,ofmankind
her,first,communication,had,reached,no,farther,than,to,state,the,fact
of,the,engagement,and,the,length,of,time,it,hadexisted
marianne,s,feelings,had,then,broken,in,and,put,an,end,to
all,regularity,of,detail,and,for,some,time,all,that,could,be
done,was,to,soothe,her,distress,lessen,her,alarms,and,combat,her
resentment

where,so,much,kindness,had,been,shown,so,much,confidence,had,been

it,was,quite,out,of,the,benevolence,of,her,heart,that,she

they,deserved,some,attention,were,harmless,well,behaved,girls,and,would,be

is,not,to,bedescribed
while,she,with,the,truest,affection,had,been,planning,a,most,eligible
connection,for,him,was,it,to,be,supposed,that,he,could,be
all,the,time,secretly,engaged,to,another,person,such,a,suspicion,could

any,profession,with,a,view,of,better,support,she,would,do,all
in,her,power,to,prevent,him,advancing,init

a,better,kind,of,girl,in,the,world,nor,one,who,more
deserves,a,goodhusband
john,dashwood,was,greatly,astonished,but,his,nature,was,calm,not,open
to,provocation,and,he,never,wished,to,offend,anybody,especially,anybody,of
goodfortune
he,therefore,replied,without,any,resentment,i,would,by,no,means,speak
disrespectfully,of,any,relation,of,yoursmadam

_they_,only,knew,how,little,he,had,had,to,tempt,him,to
be,disobedient,and,how,small,was,the,consolation,beyond,the,consciousness,of
doing,right,that,could,remain,to,him,in,the,loss,of,friends
andfortune
elinor,gloried,in,his,integrity,and,marianne,forgave,all,his,offences,in
compassion,for,hispunishment
but,though,confidence,between,them,was,by,this,public,discovery,restored,to
its,proper,state,it,was,not,a,subject,on,which,either,of
them,were,fond,of,dwelling,whenalone
elinor,avoided,it,upon,principle,as,tending,to,fix,still,more,upon
her,thoughts,by,the,too,warm,too,positive,assurances,of,marianne,that
belief,of,edward,s,continued,affection,for,herself,which,she,rather,wished
to,do,away,and,marianne,s,courage,soon,failed,her,in,trying
to,converse,upon,a,topic,which,always,left,her,more,dissatisfied,with
herself,than,ever,by,the,comparison,it,necessarily,produced,between,elinor,s
conduct,and,herown
she,felt,all,the,force,of,that,comparison,but,not,as,her
sister,had,hoped,to,urge,her,to,exertion,now,she,felt,it
with,all,the,pain,of,continual,self,reproach,regretted,most,bitterly,that
she,had,never,exerted,herself,before,but,it,brought,only,the,torture
of,penitence,without,the,hope,ofamendment
her,mind,was,so,much,weakened,that,she,still,fancied,present,exertion
impossible,and,therefore,it,only,dispirited,hermore
nothing,new,was,heard,by,them,for,a,day,or,two,afterwards
of,affairs,in,harley,street,or,bartlett,sbuildings
but,though,so,much,of,the,matter,was,known,to,them,already
that,mrs,jennings,might,have,had,enough,to,do,in,spreading,that
knowledge,farther,without,seeking,after,more,she,had,resolved,from,the,first
to,pay,a,visit,of,comfort,and,inquiry,to,her,cousins,as
soon,as,she,could,and,nothing,but,the,hindrance,of,more,visitors
than,usual,had,prevented,her,going,to,them,within,thattime
the,third,day,succeeding,their,knowledge,of,the,particulars,was,so,fine
so,beautiful,a,sunday,as,to,draw,many,to,kensington,gardens,though
it,was,only,the,second,week,inmarch
mrs,jennings,and,elinor,were,of,the,number,but,marianne,who,knew
that,the,willoughbys,were,again,in,town,and,had,a,constant,dread
of,meeting,them,chose,rather,to,stay,at,home,than,venture,into
so,public,aplace
an,intimate,acquaintance,of,mrs,jennings,joined,them,soon,after,they,entered
the,gardens,and,elinor,was,not,sorry,that,by,her,continuing,with
them,and,engaging,all,mrs,jennings,s,conversation,she,was,herself,left
to,quietreflection
she,saw,nothing,of,the,willoughbys,nothing,of,edward,and,for,some
time,nothing,of,anybody,who,could,by,any,chance,whether,grave,or
gay,be,interesting,toher
but,at,last,she,found,herself,with,some,surprise,accosted,by,miss
steele,who,though,looking,rather,shy,expressed,great,satisfaction,in,meeting,them
and,on,receiving,encouragement,from,the,particular,kindness,of,mrs,jennings,left
her,own,party,for,a,short,time,to,join,theirs

with,thirty,thousand,pounds,to,her,fortune,for,lucy,steele,that,had

to,the,point,he,was,afraid,mr,ferrars,would,be,off,and
when,edward,did,not,come,near,us,for,three,days,i,could
not,tell,what,to,think,myself,and,i,believe,in,my,heart

againstthat
however,this,morning,he,came,just,as,we,came,home,from,church
and,then,it,all,came,out,how,he,had,been,sent,for
wednesday,to,harley,street,and,been,talked,to,by,his,mother,and
all,of,them,and,how,he,had,declared,before,them,all,that

soon,as,he,had,went,away,from,his,mother,s,house,he
had,got,upon,his,horse,and,rid,into,the,country,some,where
or,other,and,how,he,had,stayed,about,at,an,inn,all
thursday,and,friday,on,purpose,to,get,the,better,ofit
and,after,thinking,it,all,over,and,over,again,he,said,it
seemed,to,him,as,if,now,he,had,no,fortune,and,no
nothing,at,all,it,would,be,quite,unkind,to,keep,her,on
to,the,engagement,because,it,must,be,for,her,loss,for,he
had,nothing,but,two,thousand,pounds,and,no,hope,of,any,thing
else,and,if,he,was,to,go,into,orders,as,he,had
some,thoughts,he,could,get,nothing,but,a,curacy,and,how,was
they,to,live,upon,that,he,could,not,bear,to,think,of
her,doing,no,better,and,so,he,begged,if,she,had,the
least,mind,for,it,to,put,an,end,to,the,matter,directly
and,leave,him,shift,forhimself
i,heard,him,say,all,this,as,plain,as,could,possiblybe

elinor,was,hardly,less,anxious,than,herself,for,their,removal,and,only
so,much,less,bent,on,its,being,effected,immediately,as,that,she
was,conscious,of,the,difficulties,of,so,long,a,journey,which,marianne
could,not,be,brought,toacknowledge
she,began,however,seriously,to,turn,her,thoughts,towards,its,accomplishment,and
had,already,mentioned,their,wishes,to,their,kind,hostess,who,resisted,them
with,all,the,eloquence,of,her,good,will,when,a,plan,was
suggested,which,though,detaining,them,from,home,yet,a,few,weeks,longer
appeared,to,elinor,altogether,much,more,eligible,than,anyother
the,palmers,were,to,remove,to,cleveland,about,the,end,of,march
for,the,easter,holidays,and,mrs,jennings,with,both,her,friends,received
a,very,warm,invitation,from,charlotte,to,go,withthem
this,would,not,in,itself,have,been,sufficient,for,the,delicacy,of
miss,dashwood,but,it,was,enforced,with,so,much,real,politeness,by
mr,palmer,himself,as,joined,to,the,very,great,amendment,of,his
manners,towards,them,since,her,sister,had,been,known,to,be,unhappy
induced,her,to,accept,it,withpleasure
when,she,told,marianne,what,she,had,done,however,her,first,reply
was,not,veryauspicious

elinor,would,not,argue,upon,the,propriety,of,overcoming,such,feelings,she
only,endeavoured,to,counteract,them,by,working,on,others,represented,it,therefore
as,a,measure,which,would,fix,the,time,of,her,returning,to
that,dear,mother,whom,she,so,much,wished,to,see,in,a
more,eligible,more,comfortable,manner,than,any,other,plan,could,do,and
perhaps,without,any,greaterdelay
from,cleveland,which,was,within,a,few,miles,of,bristol,the,distance
to,barton,was,not,beyond,one,day,though,a,long,day,s
journey,and,their,mother,s,servant,might,easily,come,there,to,attend
them,down,and,as,there,could,be,no,occasion,of,their,staying
above,a,week,at,cleveland,they,might,now,be,at,home,in
little,more,than,three,weekstime
as,marianne,s,affection,for,her,mother,was,sincere,it,must,triumph
with,little,difficulty,over,the,imaginary,evils,she,hadstarted
mrs,jennings,was,so,far,from,being,weary,of,her,guest,that
she,pressed,them,very,earnestly,to,return,with,her,again,fromcleveland
elinor,was,grateful,for,the,attention,but,it,could,not,alter,her
design,and,their,mother,s,concurrence,being,readily,gained,every,thing,relative
to,their,return,was,arranged,as,far,as,it,could,be,and
marianne,found,some,relief,in,drawing,up,a,statement,of,the,hours
that,were,yet,to,divide,her,frombarton

the,miss,dashwoods,was,mrs,jennings,s,address,to,him,when,he
first,called,on,her,after,their,leaving,her,was,settled,for,they
are,quite,resolved,upon,going,home,from,the,palmers,and,how,forlorn
we,shall,be,when,i,come,backlord
we,shall,sit,and,gape,at,one,another,as,dull,as,two
cats
perhaps,mrs,jennings,was,in,hopes,by,this,vigorous,sketch,of,their
future,ennui,to,provoke,him,to,make,that,offer,which,might,give
himself,an,escape,from,it,and,if,so,she,had,soon,afterwards
good,reason,to,think,her,object,gained,for,on,elinor,s,moving
to,the,window,to,take,more,expeditiously,the,dimensions,of,a,print
which,she,was,going,to,copy,for,her,friend,he,followed,her
to,it,with,a,look,of,particular,meaning,and,conversed,with,her
there,for,severalminutes
the,effect,of,his,discourse,on,the,lady,too,could,not,escape
her,observation,for,though,she,was,too,honorable,to,listen,and,had
even,changed,her,seat,on,purpose,that,she,might,_not_,hear,to
one,close,by,the,piano,forte,on,which,marianne,was,playing,she
could,not,keep,herself,from,seeing,that,elinor,changed,colour,attended,with
agitation,and,was,too,intent,on,what,he,said,to,pursue,her
employment
still,farther,in,confirmation,of,her,hopes,in,the,interval,of,marianne
s,turning,from,one,lesson,to,another,some,words,of,the,colonel
s,inevitably,reached,her,ear,in,which,he,seemed,to,be,apologising
for,the,badness,of,hishouse
this,set,the,matter,beyond,adoubt
she,wondered,indeed,at,his,thinking,it,necessary,to,do,so,but
supposed,it,to,be,the,properetiquette
what,elinor,said,in,reply,she,could,not,distinguish,but,judged,from
the,motion,of,her,lips,that,she,did,not,think,_that_,any
material,objection,and,mrs,jennings,commended,her,in,her,heart,for,being
sohonest
they,then,talked,on,for,a,few,minutes,longer,without,her,catching
a,syllable,when,another,lucky,stop,in,marianne,s,performance,brought,her
these,words,in,the,colonel,s,calm,voice,i,am,afraid,it
cannot,take,place,verysoon
astonished,and,shocked,at,so,unlover,like,a,speech,she,was,almost
ready,to,cry,outlord
what,should,hinderit
but,checking,her,desire,confined,herself,to,this,silentejaculation
this,is,very,strange,sure,he,need,not,wait,to,beolder
this,delay,on,the,colonel,s,side,however,did,not,seem,to
offend,or,mortify,his,fair,companion,in,the,least,for,on,their
breaking,up,the,conference,soon,afterwards,and,moving,different,ways,mrs,jennings
very,plainly,heard,elinor,say,and,with,a,voice,which,showed,her
to,feel,what,she,said,i,shall,always,think,myself,very,much
obliged,toyou
mrs,jennings,was,delighted,with,her,gratitude,and,only,wondered,that,after
hearing,such,a,sentence,the,colonel,should,be,able,to,take,leave
of,them,as,he,immediately,did,with,the,utmost,sang,froid,and
go,away,without,making,her,any,reply,she,had,not,thought,her
old,friend,could,have,made,so,indifferent,asuitor
what,had,really,passed,between,them,was,to,thiseffect
i,have,heard,said,he,with,great,compassion,of,the,injustice,your
friend,mr,ferrars,has,suffered,from,his,family,for,if,i,understand
the,matter,right,he,has,been,entirely,cast,off,by,them,for
persevering,in,his,engagement,with,a,very,deserving,youngwoman
have,i,been,rightly,informed,is,it,so,elinor,told,him,that
itwas
the,cruelty,the,impolitic,cruelty,he,replied,with,great,feeling,of,dividing
or,attempting,to,divide,two,young,people,long,attached,to,each,other
isterrible
mrs,ferrars,does,not,know,what,she,may,be,doing,what,she
may,drive,her,sonto
i,have,seen,mr,ferrars,two,or,three,times,in,harley,street
and,am,much,pleased,withhim
he,is,not,a,young,man,with,whom,one,can,be,intimately
acquainted,in,a,short,time,but,i,have,seen,enough,of,him
to,wish,him,well,for,his,own,sake,and,as,a,friend
of,yours,i,wish,it,stillmore
i,understand,that,he,intends,to,takeorders
will,you,be,so,good,as,to,tell,him,that,the,living
of,delaford,now,just,vacant,as,i,am,informed,by,this,day
s,post,is,his,if,he,think,it,worth,his,acceptance,but
_that_,perhaps,so,unfortunately,circumstanced,as,he,is,now,it,may,be
nonsense,to,appear,to,doubt,i,only,wish,it,were,morevaluable
it,is,a,rectory,but,a,small,one,the,late,incumbent,i
believe,did,not,make,more,than,200,l,per,annum,and,though
it,is,certainly,capable,of,improvement,i,fear,not,to,such,an
amount,as,to,afford,him,a,very,comfortableincome
such,as,it,is,however,my,pleasure,in,presenting,him,to,it
will,be,verygreat
pray,assure,him,ofit
elinor,s,astonishment,at,this,commission,could,hardly,have,been,greater,had
the,colonel,been,really,making,her,an,offer,of,hishand
the,preferment,which,only,two,days,before,she,had,considered,as,hopeless
for,edward,was,already,provided,to,enable,him,to,marry,and,_she_
of,all,people,in,the,world,was,fixed,on,to,bestow,it
her,emotion,was,such,as,mrs,jennings,had,attributed,to,a,very
different,cause,but,whatever,minor,feelings,less,pure,less,pleasing,might,have
a,share,in,that,emotion,her,esteem,for,the,general,benevolence,and
her,gratitude,for,the,particular,friendship,which,together,prompted,colonel,brandon,to
this,act,were,strongly,felt,and,warmlyexpressed
she,thanked,him,for,it,with,all,her,heart,spoke,of,edward
s,principles,and,disposition,with,that,praise,which,she,knew,them,to
deserve,and,promised,to,undertake,the,commission,with,pleasure,if,it,were
really,his,wish,to,put,off,so,agreeable,an,office,toanother
but,at,the,same,time,she,could,not,help,thinking,that,no
one,could,so,well,perform,it,ashimself
it,was,an,office,in,short,from,which,unwilling,to,give,edward
the,pain,of,receiving,an,obligation,from,_her_,she,would,have,been
very,glad,to,be,spared,herself,but,colonel,brandon,on,motives,of
equal,delicacy,declining,it,likewise,still,seemed,so,desirous,of,its,being
given,through,her,means,that,she,would,not,on,any,account,make
fartheropposition
edward,she,believed,was,still,in,town,and,fortunately,she,had,heard
his,address,from,misssteele
she,could,undertake,therefore,to,inform,him,of,it,in,the,course
of,theday
after,this,had,been,settled,colonel,brandon,began,to,talk,of,his
own,advantage,in,securing,so,respectable,and,agreeable,a,neighbour,and,_then_
it,was,that,he,mentioned,with,regret,that,the,house,was,small
and,indifferent,an,evil,which,elinor,as,mrs,jennings,had,supposed,her
to,do,made,very,light,of,at,least,as,far,as,regarded
itssize
the,smallness,of,the,house,said,she,i,cannot,imagine,any,inconvenience
to,them,for,it,will,be,in,proportion,to,their,family,and
income
by,which,the,colonel,was,surprised,to,find,that,_she_,was,considering
mr,ferrars,s,marriage,as,the,certain,consequence,of,the,presentation,for
he,did,not,suppose,it,possible,that,delaford,living,could,supply,such
an,income,as,anybody,in,his,style,of,life,would,venture,to
settle,on,and,he,saidso
this,little,rectory,_can_,do,no,more,than,make,mr,ferrars,comfortable
as,a,bachelor,it,cannot,enable,him,tomarry
i,am,sorry,to,say,that,my,patronage,ends,with,this,and
my,interest,is,hardly,moreextensive
if,however,by,an,unforeseen,chance,it,should,be,in,my,power
to,serve,him,farther,i,must,think,very,differently,of,him,from
what,i,now,do,if,i,am,not,as,ready,to,be
useful,to,him,then,as,i,sincerely,wish,i,could,be,at
present
what,i,am,now,doing,indeed,seems,nothing,at,all,since,it
can,advance,him,so,little,towards,what,must,be,his,principal,his
only,object,ofhappiness
his,marriage,must,still,be,a,distant,good,at,least,i,am
afraid,it,cannot,take,place,verysoon
such,was,the,sentence,which,when,misunderstood,so,justly,offended,the,delicate
feelings,of,mrs,jennings,but,after,this,narration,of,what,really,passed
between,colonel,brandon,and,elinor,while,they,stood,at,the,window,the
gratitude,expressed,by,the,latter,on,their,parting,may,perhaps,appear,in
general,not,less,reasonably,excited,nor,less,properly,worded,than,if,it
had,arisen,from,an,offer,ofmarriage
chapter,xl,well,miss,dashwood,said,mrs,jennings,sagaciously,smiling,as,soon
as,the,gentleman,had,withdrawn,i,do,not,ask,you,what,the
colonel,has,been,saying,to,you,for,though,upon,my,honour,i
_tried_,to,keep,out,of,hearing,i,could,not,help,catching,enough
to,understand,hisbusiness
and,i,assure,you,i,never,was,better,pleased,in,my,life
and,i,wish,you,joy,of,it,with,all,myheart
thank,you,ma,am,saidelinor
it,is,a,matter,of,great,joy,to,me,and,i,feel
the,goodness,of,colonel,brandon,mostsensibly
there,are,not,many,men,who,would,act,as,he,hasdone
few,people,who,have,so,compassionate,aheart
i,never,was,more,astonished,in,mylife
lord
my,dear,you,are,verymodest
i,an,t,the,least,astonished,at,it,in,the,world,for
i,have,often,thought,of,late,there,was,nothing,more,likely,to
happen
you,judged,from,your,knowledge,of,the,colonel,s,general,benevolence,but
at,least,you,could,not,foresee,that,the,opportunity,would,so,very
soonoccur
opportunity
repeated,mrs,jenningsoh
as,to,that,when,a,man,has,once,made,up,his,mind
to,such,a,thing,somehow,or,other,he,will,soon,find,an
opportunity
well,my,dear,i,wish,you,joy,of,it,again,and,again
and,if,ever,there,was,a,happy,couple,in,the,world,i
think,i,shall,soon,know,where,to,look,forthem
you,mean,to,go,to,delaford,after,them,i,suppose,said,elinor
with,a,faintsmile
aye,my,dear,that,i,doindeed
and,as,to,the,house,being,a,bad,one,i,do,not
know,what,the,colonel,would,be,at,for,it,is,as,good
a,one,as,ever,isaw
he,spoke,of,its,being,out,ofrepair
well,and,whose,fault,isthat
why,don,t,he,repairit
who,should,do,it,buthimself
they,were,interrupted,by,the,servant,s,coming,in,to,announce,the
carriage,being,at,the,door,and,mrs,jennings,immediately,preparing,to,go
said,well,my,dear,i,must,be,gone,before,i,have,had
half,my,talkout
but,however,we,may,have,it,all,over,in,the,evening,for
we,shall,be,quitealone
i,do,not,ask,you,to,go,with,me,for,i,dare
say,your,mind,is,too,full,of,the,matter,to,care,for
company,and,besides,you,must,long,to,tell,your,sister,all,about
it
marianne,had,left,the,room,before,the,conversationbegan
certainly,ma,am,i,shall,tell,marianne,of,it,but,i,shall
not,mention,it,at,present,to,any,bodyelse
oh
very,well,said,mrs,jennings,ratherdisappointed
then,you,would,not,have,me,tell,it,to,lucy,for,i
think,of,going,as,far,as,holborn,today
no,ma,am,not,even,lucy,if,youplease
one,day,s,delay,will,not,be,very,material,and,till,i
have,written,to,mr,ferrars,i,think,it,ought,not,to,be
mentioned,to,any,bodyelse
i,shall,do,_that_directly
it,is,of,importance,that,no,time,should,be,lost,with,him
for,he,will,of,course,have,much,to,do,relative,to,his
ordination
this,speech,at,first,puzzled,mrs,jenningsexceedingly
why,mr,ferrars,was,to,have,been,written,to,about,it,in
such,a,hurry,she,could,not,immediatelycomprehend
a,few,moments,reflection,however,produced,a,very,happy,idea,and,she
exclaimed,ohho
i,understandyou
mr,ferrars,is,to,be,theman
well,so,much,the,better,forhim
ay,to,be,sure,he,must,be,ordained,in,readiness,and,i
am,very,glad,to,find,things,are,so,forward,betweenyou
but,my,dear,is,not,this,rather,out,ofcharacter
should,not,the,colonel,writehimself
sure,he,is,the,properperson
elinor,did,not,quite,understand,the,beginning,of,mrs,jennings,s,speech
neither,did,she,think,it,worth,inquiring,into,and,therefore,only,replied
to,itsconclusion
colonel,brandon,is,so,delicate,a,man,that,he,rather,wished,any
one,to,announce,his,intentions,to,mr,ferrars,thanhimself
and,so,_you_,are,forced,to,doit
well,_that_,is,an,odd,kind,ofdelicacy
however,i,will,not,disturb,you,seeing,her,preparing,towrite
you,know,your,own,concernsbest
so,good,bye,mydear
i,have,not,heard,of,any,thing,to,please,me,so,well
since,charlotte,was,brought,tobed
and,away,she,went,but,returning,again,in,a,moment,i,have
just,been,thinking,of,betty,s,sister,mydear
i,should,be,very,glad,to,get,her,so,good,amistress
but,whether,she,would,do,for,a,lady,s,maid,i,am
sure,i,can,ttell
she,is,an,excellent,housemaid,and,works,very,well,at,herneedle
however,you,will,think,of,all,that,at,yourleisure
certainly,ma,am,replied,elinor,not,hearing,much,of,what,she,said
and,more,anxious,to,be,alone,than,to,be,mistress,of,the
subject
how,she,should,begin,how,she,should,express,herself,in,her,note
to,edward,was,now,all,herconcern
the,particular,circumstances,between,them,made,a,difficulty,of,that,which,to
any,other,person,would,have,been,the,easiest,thing,in,the,world
but,she,equally,feared,to,say,too,much,or,too,little,and
sat,deliberating,over,her,paper,with,the,pen,in,her,hand,till
broken,in,on,by,the,entrance,of,edwardhimself
he,had,met,mrs,jennings,at,the,door,in,her,way,to
the,carriage,as,he,came,to,leave,his,farewell,card,and,she
after,apologising,for,not,returning,herself,had,obliged,him,to,enter,by
saying,that,miss,dashwood,was,above,and,wanted,to,speak,with,him
on,very,particularbusiness
elinor,had,just,been,congratulating,herself,in,the,midst,of,her,perplexity
that,however,difficult,it,might,be,to,express,herself,properly,by,letter
it,was,at,least,preferable,to,giving,the,information,by,word,of
mouth,when,her,visitor,entered,to,force,her,upon,this,greatest,exertion
ofall
her,astonishment,and,confusion,were,very,great,on,his,so,suddenappearance
she,had,not,seen,him,before,since,his,engagement,became,public,and
therefore,not,since,his,knowing,her,to,be,acquainted,with,it,which
with,the,consciousness,of,what,she,had,been,thinking,of,and,what
she,had,to,tell,him,made,her,feel,particularly,uncomfortable,for,some
minutes
he,too,was,much,distressed,and,they,sat,down,together,in,a
most,promising,state,ofembarrassment
whether,he,had,asked,her,pardon,for,his,intrusion,on,first,coming
into,the,room,he,could,not,recollect,but,determining,to,be,on
the,safe,side,he,made,his,apology,in,form,as,soon,as
he,could,say,any,thing,after,taking,achair
mrs,jennings,told,me,said,he,that,you,wished,to,speak,with
me,at,least,i,understood,her,so,or,i,certainly,should,not
have,intruded,on,you,in,such,a,manner,though,at,the,same
time,i,should,have,been,extremely,sorry,to,leave,london,without,seeing
you,and,your,sister,especially,as,it,will,most,likely,be,some
time,it,is,not,probable,that,i,should,soon,have,the,pleasure
of,meeting,youagain
i,go,to,oxfordtomorrow
you,would,not,have,gone,however,said,elinor,recovering,herself,and,determined
to,get,over,what,she,so,much,dreaded,as,soon,as,possible
without,receiving,our,good,wishes,even,if,we,had,not,been,able
to,give,them,inperson
mrs,jennings,was,quite,right,in,what,shesaid
i,have,something,of,consequence,to,inform,you,of,which,i,was
on,the,point,of,communicating,bypaper
i,am,charged,with,a,most,agreeable,office,breathing,rather,faster,than
usual,as,shespoke
colonel,brandon,who,was,here,only,ten,minutes,ago,has,desired,me
to,say,that,understanding,you,mean,to,take,orders,he,has,great
pleasure,in,offering,you,the,living,of,delaford,now,just,vacant,and
only,wishes,it,were,morevaluable
allow,me,to,congratulate,you,on,having,so,respectable,and,well,judging
a,friend,and,to,join,in,his,wish,that,the,living,it
is,about,two,hundred,a,year,were,much,more,considerable,and,such
as,might,better,enable,you,to,as,might,be,more,than,a
temporary,accommodation,to,yourself,such,in,short,as,might,establish,all,your
views,ofhappiness
what,edward,felt,as,he,could,not,say,it,himself,it,cannot
be,expected,that,any,one,else,should,say,forhim
he,_looked_,all,the,astonishment,which,such,unexpected,such,unthought,of,information
could,not,fail,of,exciting,but,he,said,only,these,two,words
colonelbrandon
yes,continued,elinor,gathering,more,resolution,as,some,of,the,worst,was
over,colonel,brandon,means,it,as,a,testimony,of,his,concern,for
what,has,lately,passed,for,the,cruel,situation,in,which,the,unjustifiable
conduct,of,your,family,has,placed,you,a,concern,which,i,am
sure,marianne,myself,and,all,your,friends,must,share,and,likewise,as
a,proof,of,his,high,esteem,for,your,general,character,and,his
particular,approbation,of,your,behaviour,on,the,presentoccasion
colonel,brandon,give,_me_,a,living,can,it,bepossible
the,unkindness,of,your,own,relations,has,made,you,astonished,to,find
friendship,anywhere
no,replied,be,with,sudden,consciousness,not,to,find,it,in,_you_
for,i,cannot,be,ignorant,that,to,you,to,your,goodness,i
owe,itall
i,feel,it,i,would,express,it,if,i,could,but,as
you,well,know,i,am,noorator
you,are,very,muchmistaken
i,do,assure,you,that,you,owe,it,entirely,at,least,almost
entirely,to,your,own,merit,and,colonel,brandon,s,discernment,ofit
i,have,had,no,hand,init
i,did,not,even,know,till,i,understood,his,design,that,the
living,was,vacant,nor,had,it,ever,occurred,to,me,that,he
might,have,had,such,a,living,in,hisgift
as,a,friend,of,mine,of,my,family,he,may,perhaps,indeed
i,know,he,_has_,still,greater,pleasure,in,bestowing,it,but,upon
my,word,you,owe,nothing,to,mysolicitation
truth,obliged,her,to,acknowledge,some,small,share,in,the,action,but
she,was,at,the,same,time,so,unwilling,to,appear,as,the
benefactress,of,edward,that,she,acknowledged,it,with,hesitation,which,probably,contributed
to,fix,that,suspicion,in,his,mind,which,had,recently,enteredit
for,a,short,time,he,sat,deep,in,thought,after,elinor,had
ceased,to,speak,at,last,and,as,if,it,were,rather,an
effort,he,said,colonel,brandon,seems,a,man,of,great,worth,and
respectability
i,have,always,heard,him,spoken,of,as,such,and,your,brother
i,know,esteems,himhighly
he,is,undoubtedly,a,sensible,man,and,in,his,manners,perfectly,the
gentleman
indeed,replied,elinor,i,believe,that,you,will,find,him,on,farther
acquaintance,all,that,you,have,heard,him,to,be,and,as,you
will,be,such,very,near,neighbours,for,i,understand,the,parsonage,is
almost,close,to,the,mansion,house,it,is,particularly,important,that,he
_should_,be,allthis
edward,made,no,answer,but,when,she,had,turned,away,her,head
gave,her,a,look,so,serious,so,earnest,so,uncheerful,as,seemed
to,say,that,he,might,hereafter,wish,the,distance,between,the,parsonage
and,the,mansion,house,muchgreater
colonel,brandon,i,think,lodges,in,st,james,street,said,he,soon
afterwards,rising,from,hischair
elinor,told,him,the,number,of,thehouse
i,must,hurry,away,then,to,give,him,those,thanks,which,you
will,not,allow,me,to,give,_you_,to,assure,him,that,he
has,made,me,a,very,an,exceedingly,happyman
elinor,did,not,offer,to,detain,him,and,they,parted,with,a
very,earnest,assurance,on,_her_,side,of,her,unceasing,good,wishes,for
his,happiness,in,every,change,of,situation,that,might,befall,him,on
_his_,with,rather,an,attempt,to,return,the,same,good,will,than
the,power,of,expressingit
when,i,see,him,again,said,elinor,to,herself,as,the,door
shut,him,out,i,shall,see,him,the,husband,oflucy
and,with,this,pleasing,anticipation,she,sat,down,to,reconsider,the,past
recall,the,words,and,endeavour,to,comprehend,all,the,feelings,of,edward
and,of,course,to,reflect,on,her,own,withdiscontent
when,mrs,jennings,came,home,though,she,returned,from,seeing,people,whom
she,had,never,seen,before,and,of,whom,therefore,she,must,have
a,great,deal,to,say,her,mind,was,so,much,more,occupied
by,the,important,secret,in,her,possession,than,by,anything,else,that
she,reverted,to,it,again,as,soon,as,elinorappeared
well,my,dear,she,cried,i,sent,you,up,the,youngman
did,not,i,do,right,and,i,suppose,you,had,no,great
difficulty,you,did,not,find,him,very,unwilling,to,accept,yourproposal
no,ma,am,_that_,was,not,verylikely
well,and,how,soon,will,he,be,ready,for,it,seems,all
to,depend,uponthat
really,said,elinor,i,know,so,little,of,these,kind,of,forms
that,i,can,hardly,even,conjecture,as,to,the,time,or,the
preparation,necessary,but,i,suppose,two,or,three,months,will,complete,his
ordination
two,or,threemonths
cried,mrs,jenningslord
my,dear,how,calmly,you,talk,of,it,and,can,the,colonel
wait,two,or,threemonths

of,patience,and,though,one,would,be,very,glad,to,do,a
kindness,by,poor,mr,ferrars,i,do,think,it,is,not,worth
while,to,wait,two,or,three,months,forhim
sure,somebody,else,might,be,found,that,would,do,as,well,somebody
that,is,in,ordersalready
my,dear,ma,am,said,elinor,what,can,you,be,thinkingof
why,colonel,brandon,s,only,object,is,to,be,of,use,to
mr

and,an,explanation,immediately,took,place,by,which,both,gained,considerable,amusement
for,the,moment,without,any,material,loss,of,happiness,to,either,for
mrs,jennings,only,exchanged,one,form,of,delight,for,another,and,still
without,forfeiting,her,expectation,of,thefirst
aye,aye,the,parsonage,is,but,a,small,one,said,she,after
the,first,ebullition,of,surprise,and,satisfaction,was,over,and,very,likely
_may_,be,out,of,repair,but,to,hear,a,man,apologising,as
i,thought,for,a,house,that,to,my,knowledge,has,five,sitting
rooms,on,the,ground,floor,and,i,think,the,housekeeper,told,me
could,make,up,fifteenbeds
and,to,you,too,that,had,been,used,to,live,in,barton
cottage
it,seems,quiteridiculous
but,my,dear,we,must,touch,up,the,colonel,to,do,some
thing,to,the,parsonage,and,make,it,comfortable,for,them,before,lucy
goes,toit
but,colonel,brandon,does,not,seem,to,have,any,idea,of,the
living,s,being,enough,to,allow,them,tomarry
the,colonel,is,a,ninny,my,dear,because,he,has,two,thousand
a,year,himself,he,thinks,that,nobody,else,can,marry,onless
take,my,word,for,it,that,if,i,am,alive,i,shall
be,paying,a,visit,at,delaford,parsonage,before,michaelmas,and,i,am
sure,i,shan,t,go,if,lucy,an,tthere
elinor,was,quite,of,her,opinion,as,to,the,probability,of,their
not,waiting,for,any,thingmore
chapter,xli,edward,having,carried,his,thanks,to,colonel,brandon,proceeded,with
his,happiness,to,lucy,and,such,was,the,excess,of,it,by
the,time,he,reached,bartlett,s,buildings,that,she,was,able,to
assure,mrs,jennings,who,called,on,her,again,the,next,day,with
her,congratulations,that,she,had,never,seen,him,in,such,spirits,before
in,herlife
her,own,happiness,and,her,own,spirits,were,at,least,very,certain
and,she,joined,mrs,jennings,most,heartily,in,her,expectation,of,their
being,all,comfortably,together,in,delaford,parsonage,beforemichaelmas
so,far,was,she,at,the,same,time,from,any,backwardness,to
give,elinor,that,credit,which,edward,_would_,give,her,that,she,spoke
of,her,friendship,for,them,both,with,the,most,grateful,warmth,was
ready,to,own,all,their,obligation,to,her,and,openly,declared,that
no,exertion,for,their,good,on,miss,dashwood,s,part,either,present
or,future,would,ever,surprise,her,for,she,believed,her,capable,of
doing,any,thing,in,the,world,for,those,she,reallyvalued
as,for,colonel,brandon,she,was,not,only,ready,to,worship,him
as,a,saint,but,was,moreover,truly,anxious,that,he,should,be
treated,as,one,in,all,worldly,concerns,anxious,that,his,tithes,should
be,raised,to,the,utmost,and,scarcely,resolved,to,avail,herself,at
delaford,as,far,as,she,possibly,could,of,his,servants,his,carriage
his,cows,and,hispoultry
it,was,now,above,a,week,since,john,dashwood,had,called,in
berkeley,street,and,as,since,that,time,no,notice,had,been,taken
by,them,of,his,wife,s,indisposition,beyond,one,verbal,enquiry,elinor
began,to,feel,it,necessary,to,pay,her,avisit
this,was,an,obligation,however,which,not,only,opposed,her,own,inclination
but,which,had,not,the,assistance,of,any,encouragement,from,hercompanions
marianne,not,contented,with,absolutely,refusing,to,go,herself,was,very,urgent
to,prevent,her,sister,s,going,at,all,and,mrs,jennings,though
her,carriage,was,always,at,elinor,s,service,so,very,much,disliked
mrs,john,dashwood,that,not,even,her,curiosity,to,see,how,she
looked,after,the,late,discovery,nor,her,strong,desire,to,affront,her
by,taking,edward,s,part,could,overcome,her,unwillingness,to,be,in
her,companyagain
the,consequence,was,that,elinor,set,out,by,herself,to,pay,a
visit,for,which,no,one,could,really,have,less,inclination,and,to
run,the,risk,of,a,tête,à,tête,with,a,woman,whom
neither,of,the,others,had,so,much,reason,todislike
mrs,dashwood,was,denied,but,before,the,carriage,could,turn,from,the
house,her,husband,accidentally,cameout
he,expressed,great,pleasure,in,meeting,elinor,told,her,that,he,had
been,just,going,to,call,in,berkeley,street,and,assuring,her,that
fanny,would,be,very,glad,to,see,her,invited,her,to,come
in
they,walked,up,stairs,in,to,the,drawingroom
nobody,wasthere
fanny,is,in,her,own,room,i,suppose,said,he,i,will
go,to,her,presently,for,i,am,sure,she,will,not,have
the,least,objection,in,the,world,to,seeing,_you,_,very,far
from,itindeed
_now_,especially,there,cannot,be,but,however,you,and,marianne,were,always
greatfavourites
why,would,not,mariannecome
elinor,made,what,excuse,she,could,forher
i,am,not,sorry,to,see,you,alone,he,replied,for,i
have,a,good,deal,to,say,toyou
this,living,of,colonel,brandon,s,can,it,be,true,has,he
really,given,it,to,edward,i,heard,it,yesterday,by,chance,and
was,coming,to,you,on,purpose,to,enquire,farther,aboutit
it,is,perfectlytrue
colonel,brandon,has,given,the,living,of,delaford,toedward
really,well,this,is,very,astonishing,no,relationship,no,connection,between,them
and,now,that,livings,fetch,such,a,price,what,was,the,value
ofthis
about,two,hundred,ayear
very,well,and,for,the,next,presentation,to,a,living,of,that
value,supposing,the,late,incumbent,to,have,been,old,and,sickly,and
likely,to,vacate,it,soon,he,might,have,got,i,dare,say
fourteen,hundredpounds
and,how,came,he,not,to,have,settled,that,matter,before,this
person,sdeath
_now_,indeed,it,would,be,too,late,to,sell,it,but,a
man,of,colonel,brandon,s,sense,i,wonder,he,should,be,so
improvident,in,a,point,of,such,common,such,natural,concern,well,i
am,convinced,that,there,is,a,vast,deal,of,inconsistency,in,almost
every,humancharacter
i,suppose,however,on,recollection,that,the,case,may,probably,be,_this
_,edward,is,only,to,hold,the,living,till,the,person,to
whom,the,colonel,has,really,sold,the,presentation,is,old,enough,to
takeit
aye,aye,that,is,the,fact,depend,uponit
elinor,contradicted,it,however,very,positively,and,by,relating,that,she,had
herself,been,employed,in,conveying,the,offer,from,colonel,brandon,to,edward
and,therefore,must,understand,the,terms,on,which,it,was,given,obliged
him,to,submit,to,herauthority
it,is,trulyastonishing
he,cried,after,hearing,what,she,said,what,could,be,the,colonel
smotive
a,very,simple,one,to,be,of,use,tomr
ferrars
well,well,whatever,colonel,brandon,may,be,edward,is,a,very,lucky
man
you,will,not,mention,the,matter,to,fanny,however,for,though,i
have,broke,it,to,her,and,she,bears,it,vastly,well,she
will,not,like,to,hear,it,much,talkedof
elinor,had,some,difficulty,here,to,refrain,from,observing,that,she,thought
fanny,might,have,borne,with,composure,an,acquisition,of,wealth,to,her
brother,by,which,neither,she,nor,her,child,could,be,possiblyimpoverished
mrs,ferrars,added,he,lowering,his,voice,to,the,tone,becoming,so
important,a,subject,knows,nothing,about,it,at,present,and,i,believe

word,infection,to,pass,his,lips,gave,instant,alarm,to,mrs,palmer
on,her,baby,saccount
mrs,jennings,who,had,been,inclined,from,the,first,to,think,marianne
s,complaint,more,serious,than,elinor,now,looked,very,grave,on,mr
harris,s,report,and,confirming,charlotte,s,fears,and,caution,urged,the
necessity,of,her,immediate,removal,with,her,infant,and,mr,palmer,though
treating,their,apprehensions,as,idle,found,the,anxiety,and,importunity,of,his
wife,too,great,to,bewithstood
her,departure,therefore,was,fixed,on,and,within,an,hour,after,mr
harris,s,arrival,she,set,off,with,her,little,boy,and,his
nurse,for,the,house,of,a,near,relation,of,mr,palmer,s
who,lived,a,few,miles,on,the,other,side,of,bath,whither
her,husband,promised,at,her,earnest,entreaty,to,join,her,in,a
day,or,two,and,whither,she,was,almost,equally,urgent,with,her
mother,to,accompanyher
mrs,jennings,however,with,a,kindness,of,heart,which,made,elinor,really
love,her,declared,her,resolution,of,not,stirring,from,cleveland,as,long
as,marianne,remained,ill,and,of,endeavouring,by,her,own,attentive,care
to,supply,to,her,the,place,of,the,mother,she,had,taken
her,from,and,elinor,found,her,on,every,occasion,a,most,willing
and,active,helpmate,desirous,to,share,in,all,her,fatigues,and,often
by,her,better,experience,in,nursing,of,materialuse
poor,marianne,languid,and,low,from,the,nature,of,her,malady,and
feeling,herself,universally,ill,could,no,longer,hope,that,tomorrow,would,find
her,recovered,and,the,idea,of,what,tomorrow,would,have,produced,but
for,this,unlucky,illness,made,every,ailment,severe,for,on,that,day
they,were,to,have,begun,their,journey,home,and,attended,the,whole
way,by,a,servant,of,mrs,jennings,were,to,have,taken,their
mother,by,surprise,on,the,followingforenoon
the,little,she,said,was,all,in,lamentation,of,this,inevitable,delay
though,elinor,tried,to,raise,her,spirits,and,make,her,believe,as
she,_then_,really,believed,herself,that,it,would,be,a,very,short
one
the,next,day,produced,little,or,no,alteration,in,the,state,of
the,patient,she,certainly,was,not,better,and,except,that,there,was
no,amendment,did,not,appearworse
their,party,was,now,farther,reduced,for,mr,palmer,though,very,unwilling
to,go,as,well,from,real,humanity,and,good,nature,as,from
a,dislike,of,appearing,to,be,frightened,away,by,his,wife,was
persuaded,at,last,by,colonel,brandon,to,perform,his,promise,of,following
her,and,while,he,was,preparing,to,go,colonel,brandon,himself,with
a,much,greater,exertion,began,to,talk,of,goinglikewise
here,however,the,kindness,of,mrs,jennings,interposed,most,acceptably,for,to
send,the,colonel,away,while,his,love,was,in,so,much,uneasiness
on,her,sister,s,account,would,be,to,deprive,them,both,she
thought,of,every,comfort,and,therefore,telling,him,at,once,that,his
stay,at,cleveland,was,necessary,to,herself,that,she,should,want,him
to,play,at,piquet,of,an,evening,while,miss,dashwood,was,above
with,her,sister,c,she,urged,him,so,strongly,to,remain,that
he,who,was,gratifying,the,first,wish,of,his,own,heart,by
a,compliance,could,not,long,even,affect,to,demur,especially,as,mrs
jennings,s,entreaty,was,warmly,seconded,by,mr,palmer,who,seemed,to
feel,a,relief,to,himself,in,leaving,behind,him,a,person,so
well,able,to,assist,or,advise,miss,dashwood,in,anyemergence
marianne,was,of,course,kept,in,ignorance,of,all,thesearrangements
she,knew,not,that,she,had,been,the,means,of,sending,the
owners,of,cleveland,away,in,about,seven,days,from,the,time,of
theirarrival
it,gave,her,no,surprise,that,she,saw,nothing,of,mrs,palmer
and,as,it,gave,her,likewise,no,concern,she,never,mentioned,her
name
two,days,passed,away,from,the,time,of,mr,palmer,s,departure
and,her,situation,continued,with,little,variation,thesame
mr,harris,who,attended,her,every,day,still,talked,boldly,of,a
speedy,recovery,and,miss,dashwood,was,equally,sanguine,but,the,expectation,of
the,others,was,by,no,means,socheerful
mrs,jennings,had,determined,very,early,in,the,seizure,that,marianne,would
never,get,over,it,and,colonel,brandon,who,was,chiefly,of,use
in,listening,to,mrs,jennings,s,forebodings,was,not,in,a,state
of,mind,to,resist,theirinfluence
he,tried,to,reason,himself,out,of,fears,which,the,different,judgment
of,the,apothecary,seemed,to,render,absurd,but,the,many,hours,of
each,day,in,which,he,was,left,entirely,alone,were,but,too
favourable,for,the,admission,of,every,melancholy,idea,and,he,could,not
expel,from,his,mind,the,persuasion,that,he,should,see,marianne,no
more
on,the,morning,of,the,third,day,however,the,gloomy,anticipations,of
both,were,almost,done,away,for,when,mr,harris,arrived,he,declared
his,patient,materiallybetter
her,pulse,was,much,stronger,and,every,symptom,more,favourable,than,on
the,precedingvisit
elinor,confirmed,in,every,pleasant,hope,was,all,cheerfulness,rejoicing,that,in
her,letters,to,her,mother,she,had,pursued,her,own,judgment,rather
than,her,friend,s,in,making,very,light,of,the,indisposition,which
delayed,them,at,cleveland,and,almost,fixing,on,the,time,when,marianne
would,be,able,totravel
but,the,day,did,not,close,so,auspiciously,as,itbegan
towards,the,evening,marianne,became,ill,again,growing,more,heavy,restless,and
uncomfortable,thanbefore
her,sister,however,still,sanguine,was,willing,to,attribute,the,change,to
nothing,more,than,the,fatigue,of,having,sat,up,to,have,her
bed,made,and,carefully,administering,the,cordials,prescribed,saw,her,with,satisfaction
sink,at,last,into,a,slumber,from,which,she,expected,the,most
beneficialeffects
her,sleep,though,not,so,quiet,as,elinor,wished,to,see,it
lasted,a,considerable,time,and,anxious,to,observe,the,result,of,it
herself,she,resolved,to,sit,with,her,during,the,whole,ofit
mrs,jennings,knowing,nothing,of,any,change,in,the,patient,went,unusually
early,to,bed,her,maid,who,was,one,of,the,principal,nurses
was,recreating,herself,in,the,housekeeper,s,room,and,elinor,remained,alone
withmarianne
the,repose,of,the,latter,became,more,and,more,disturbed,and,her
sister,who,watched,with,unremitting,attention,her,continual,change,of,posture,and
heard,the,frequent,but,inarticulate,sounds,of,complaint,which,passed,her,lips
was,almost,wishing,to,rouse,her,from,so,painful,a,slumber,when
marianne,suddenly,awakened,by,some,accidental,noise,in,the,house,started,hastily
up,and,with,feverish,wildness,cried,out,is,mama,coming,not,yet
cried,the,other,concealing,her,terror,and,assisting,marianne,to,lie,down
again,but,she,will,be,here,i,hope,before,it,islong
it,is,a,great,way,you,know,from,hence,tobarton
but,she,must,not,go,round,by,london,cried,marianne,in,the
same,hurriedmanner
i,shall,never,see,her,if,she,goes,bylondon
elinor,perceived,with,alarm,that,she,was,not,quite,herself,and,while
attempting,to,soothe,her,eagerly,felt,herpulse
it,was,lower,and,quicker,thanever
and,marianne,still,talking,wildly,of,mama,her,alarm,increased,so,rapidly
as,to,determine,her,on,sending,instantly,for,mr,harris,and,despatching
a,messenger,to,barton,for,hermother
to,consult,with,colonel,brandon,on,the,best,means,of,effecting,the
latter,was,a,thought,which,immediately,followed,the,resolution,of,its,performance
and,as,soon,she,had,rung,up,the,maid,to,take,her
place,by,her,sister,she,hastened,down,to,the,drawing,room,where
she,knew,he,was,generally,to,be,found,at,a,much,later
hour,than,thepresent
it,was,no,time,forhesitation
her,fears,and,her,difficulties,were,immediately,beforehim
her,fears,he,had,no,courage,no,confidence,to,attempt,the,removal
of,he,listened,to,them,in,silent,despondence,but,her,difficulties,were
instantly,obviated,for,with,a,readiness,that,seemed,to,speak,the,occasion
and,the,service,pre,arranged,in,his,mind,he,offered,himself,as
the,messenger,who,should,fetch,mrsdashwood
elinor,made,no,resistance,that,was,not,easilyovercome
she,thanked,him,with,brief,though,fervent,gratitude,and,while,he,went
to,hurry,off,his,servant,with,a,message,to,mr,harris,and
an,order,for,post,horses,directly,she,wrote,a,few,lines,to
hermother
the,comfort,of,such,a,friend,at,that,moment,as,colonel,brandon
or,such,a,companion,for,her,mother,how,gratefully,was,it,felt
a,companion,whose,judgment,would,guide,whose,attendance,must,relieve,and,whose
friendship,might,soothe,her,as,far,as,the,shock,of,such,a
summons,_could_,be,lessened,to,her,his,presence,his,manners,his,assistance
would,lessenit
_he_,meanwhile,whatever,he,might,feel,acted,with,all,the,firmness,of
a,collected,mind,made,every,necessary,arrangement,with,the,utmost,despatch,and
calculated,with,exactness,the,time,in,which,she,might,look,for,his
return
not,a,moment,was,lost,in,delay,of,anykind
the,horses,arrived,even,before,they,were,expected,and,colonel,brandon,only
pressing,her,hand,with,a,look,of,solemnity,and,a,few,words
spoken,too,low,to,reach,her,ear,hurried,into,thecarriage
it,was,then,about,twelve,o,clock,and,she,returned,to,her
sister,s,apartment,to,wait,for,the,arrival,of,the,apothecary,and
to,watch,by,her,the,rest,of,thenight
it,was,a,night,of,almost,equal,suffering,toboth
hour,after,hour,passed,away,in,sleepless,pain,and,delirium,on,marianne
s,side,and,in,the,most,cruel,anxiety,on,elinor,s,before
mr,harrisappeared
her,apprehensions,once,raised,paid,by,their,excess,for,all,her,former
security,and,the,servant,who,sat,up,with,her,for,she,would
not,allow,mrs,jennings,to,be,called,only,tortured,her,more,by
hints,of,what,her,mistress,had,alwaysthought
marianne,s,ideas,were,still,at,intervals,fixed,incoherently,on,her,mother
and,whenever,she,mentioned,her,name,it,gave,a,pang,to,the
heart,of,poor,elinor,who,reproaching,herself,for,having,trifled,with,so
many,days,of,illness,and,wretched,for,some,immediate,relief,fancied,that
all,relief,might,soon,be,in,vain,that,every,thing,had,been
delayed,too,long,and,pictured,to,herself,her,suffering,mother,arriving,too
late,to,see,this,darling,child,or,to,see,herrational
she,was,on,the,point,of,sending,again,for,mr,harris,or
if,_he_,could,not,come,for,some,other,advice,when,the,former
but,not,till,after,five,o,clockarrived
his,opinion,however,made,some,little,amends,for,his,delay,for,though
acknowledging,a,very,unexpected,and,unpleasant,alteration,in,his,patient,he,would
not,allow,the,danger,to,be,material,and,talked,of,the,relief
which,a,fresh,mode,of,treatment,must,procure,with,a,confidence,which
in,a,lesser,degree,was,communicated,toelinor
he,promised,to,call,again,in,the,course,of,three,or,four
hours,and,left,both,the,patient,and,her,anxious,attendant,more,composed
than,he,had,foundthem
with,strong,concern,and,with,many,reproaches,for,not,being,called,to
their,aid,did,mrs,jennings,hear,in,the,morning,of,what,had
passed
her,former,apprehensions,now,with,greater,reason,restored,left,her,no,doubt
of,the,event,and,though,trying,to,speak,comfort,to,elinor,her
conviction,of,her,sister,s,danger,would,not,allow,her,to,offer
the,comfort,ofhope
her,heart,was,reallygrieved
the,rapid,decay,the,early,death,of,a,girl,so,young,so
lovely,as,marianne,must,have,struck,a,less,interested,person,withconcern
on,mrs,jennings,s,compassion,she,had,otherclaims
she,had,been,for,three,months,her,companion,was,still,under,her
care,and,she,was,known,to,have,been,greatly,injured,and,long
unhappy
the,distress,of,her,sister,too,particularly,a,favourite,was,before,her
and,as,for,their,mother,when,mrs,jennings,considered,that,marianne,might
probably,be,to,_her_,what,charlotte,was,to,herself,her,sympathy,in
_her_,sufferings,was,verysincere
mr,harris,was,punctual,in,his,second,visit,but,he,came,to
be,disappointed,in,his,hopes,of,what,the,last,wouldproduce
his,medicines,had,failed,the,fever,was,unabated,and,marianne,only,more
quiet,not,more,herself,remained,in,a,heavystupor
elinor,catching,all,and,more,than,all,his,fears,in,a,moment
proposed,to,call,in,furtheradvice
but,he,judged,it,unnecessary,he,had,still,something,more,to,try
some,more,fresh,application,of,whose,success,he,was,as,confident,as
the,last,and,his,visit,concluded,with,encouraging,assurances,which,reached,the
ear,but,could,not,enter,the,heart,of,missdashwood
she,was,calm,except,when,she,thought,of,her,mother,but,she
was,almost,hopeless,and,in,this,state,she,continued,till,noon,scarcely
stirring,from,her,sister,s,bed,her,thoughts,wandering,from,one,image
of,grief,one,suffering,friend,to,another,and,her,spirits,oppressed,to
the,utmost,by,the,conversation,of,mrs,jennings,who,scrupled,not,to
attribute,the,severity,and,danger,of,this,attack,to,the,many,weeks
of,previous,indisposition,which,marianne,s,disappointment,had,broughton
elinor,felt,all,the,reasonableness,of,the,idea,and,it,gave,fresh
misery,to,herreflections
about,noon,however,she,began,but,with,a,caution,a,dread,of
disappointment,which,for,some,time,kept,her,silent,even,to,her,friend
to,fancy,to,hope,she,could,perceive,a,slight,amendment,in,her
sister,s,pulse,she,waited,watched,and,examined,it,again,and,again
and,at,last,with,an,agitation,more,difficult,to,bury,under,exterior
calmness,than,all,her,foregoing,distress,ventured,to,communicate,herhopes
mrs,jennings,though,forced,on,examination,to,acknowledge,a,temporary,revival,tried
to,keep,her,young,friend,from,indulging,a,thought,of,its,continuance
and,elinor,conning,over,every,injunction,of,distrust,told,herself,likewise,not
tohope
but,it,was,toolate
hope,had,already,entered,and,feeling,all,its,anxious,flutter,she,bent
over,her,sister,to,watch,she,hardly,knew,forwhat
half,an,hour,passed,away,and,the,favourable,symptom,yet,blessedher
others,even,arose,to,confirmit
her,breath,her,skin,her,lips,all,flattered,elinor,with,signs,of
amendment,and,marianne,fixed,her,eyes,on,her,with,a,rational,though
languidgaze
anxiety,and,hope,now,oppressed,her,in,equal,degrees,and,left,her
no,moment,of,tranquillity,till,the,arrival,of,mr,harris,at,four
o,clock,when,his,assurances,his,felicitations,on,a,recovery,in,her
sister,even,surpassing,his,expectation,gave,her,confidence,comfort,and,tears,of
joy
marianne,was,in,every,respect,materially,better,and,he,declared,her,entirely
out,ofdanger
mrs,jennings,perhaps,satisfied,with,the,partial,justification,of,her,forebodings,which
had,been,found,in,their,late,alarm,allowed,herself,to,trust,in
his,judgment,and,admitted,with,unfeigned,joy,and,soon,with,unequivocal,cheerfulness
the,probability,of,an,entirerecovery
elinor,could,not,becheerful
her,joy,was,of,a,different,kind,and,led,to,any,thing
rather,than,togaiety
marianne,restored,to,life,health,friends,and,to,her,doting,mother,was
an,idea,to,fill,her,heart,with,sensations,of,exquisite,comfort,and
expand,it,in,fervent,gratitude,but,it,lead,to,no,outward,demonstrations
of,joy,no,words,nosmiles
all,within,elinor,s,breast,was,satisfaction,silent,andstrong
she,continued,by,the,side,of,her,sister,with,little,intermission,the
whole,afternoon,calming,every,fear,satisfying,every,inquiry,of,her,enfeebled,spirits
supplying,every,succour,and,watching,almost,every,look,and,everybreath
the,possibility,of,a,relapse,would,of,course,in,some,moments,occur
to,remind,her,of,what,anxiety,was,but,when,she,saw,on
her,frequent,and,minute,examination,that,every,symptom,of,recovery,continued,and
saw,marianne,at,six,o,clock,sink,into,a,quiet,steady,and
to,all,appearance,comfortable,sleep,she,silenced,everydoubt
the,time,was,now,drawing,on,when,colonel,brandon,might,be,expected
back
at,ten,o,clock,she,trusted,or,at,least,not,much,later
her,mother,would,be,relieved,from,the,dreadful,suspense,in,which,she
must,now,be,travelling,towardsthem
the,colonel,too,perhaps,scarcely,less,an,object,ofpity
oh
how,slow,was,the,progress,of,time,which,yet,kept,them,in
ignorance
at,seven,o,clock,leaving,marianne,still,sweetly,asleep,she,joined,mrs
jennings,in,the,drawing,room,totea
of,breakfast,she,had,been,kept,by,her,fears,and,of,dinner
by,their,sudden,reverse,from,eating,much,and,the,present,refreshment,therefore
with,such,feelings,of,content,as,she,brought,to,it,was,particularly
welcome
mrs,jennings,would,have,persuaded,her,at,its,conclusion,to,take,some
rest,before,her,mother,s,arrival,and,allow,_her_,to,take,her
place,by,marianne,but,elinor,had,no,sense,of,fatigue,no,capability
of,sleep,at,that,moment,about,her,and,she,was,not,to
be,kept,away,from,her,sister,an,unnecessaryinstant
mrs,jennings,therefore,attending,her,up,stairs,into,the,sick,chamber,to
satisfy,herself,that,all,continued,right,left,her,there,again,to,her
charge,and,her,thoughts,and,retired,to,her,own,room,to,write

the,clock,struckeight
had,it,been,ten,elinor,would,have,been,convinced,that,at,that

strong,was,the,persuasion,that,she,_did_,in,spite,of,the,_almost_
impossibility,of,their,being,already,come,that,she,moved,into,the,adjoining
dressing,closet,and,opened,a,window,shutter,to,be,satisfied,of,the
truth
she,instantly,saw,that,her,ears,had,not,deceivedher
the,flaring,lamps,of,a,carriage,were,immediately,inview
by,their,uncertain,light,she,thought,she,could,discern,it,to,be
drawn,by,four,horses,and,this,while,it,told,the,excess,of
her,poor,mother,s,alarm,gave,some,explanation,to,such,unexpectedrapidity
never,in,her,life,had,elinor,found,it,so,difficult,to,be
calm,as,at,thatmoment
the,knowledge,of,what,her,mother,must,be,feeling,as,the,carriage

of,what,_she_,had,totell
with,such,knowledge,it,was,impossible,to,becalm

it
careless,of,her,happiness,thinking,only,of,my,own,amusement,giving,way

intention,to,re,establish,my,circumstances,by,marrying,a,woman,offortune
to,attach,myself,to,your,sister,therefore,was,not,a,thing,to

that,he,had,cut,me,ever,since,my,marriage,i,had,seen
without,surprise,orresentment
now,however,his,good,natured,honest,stupid,soul,full,of,indignation,against
me,and,concern,for,your,sister,could,not,resist,the,temptation,of
telling,me,what,he,knew,ought,to,though,probably,he,did,not
think,it,_would_,vex,mehorridly
as,bluntly,as,he,could,speak,it,therefore,he,told,me,that

much,shocked,to,be,able,to,pass,myself,off,as,insensible,even
to,the,undiscerning,sirjohn
his,heart,was,softened,in,seeing,mine,suffer,and,so,much,of
his,ill,will,was,done,away,that,when,we,parted,he,almost
shook,me,by,the,hand,while,he,reminded,me,of,an,old
promise,about,a,pointerpuppy
what,i,felt,on,hearing,that,your,sister,was,dying,and,dying
too,believing,me,the,greatest,villain,upon,earth,scorning,hating,me,in

little,scruple,left,her,sister,to,misery,was,likely,to,prove,a
source,of,unhappiness,to,himself,of,a,far,more,incurablenature
from,a,reverie,of,this,kind,she,was,recalled,at,the,end
of,some,minutes,by,willoughby,who,rousing,himself,from,a,reverie,at

and,with,these,words,he,almost,ran,out,of,theroom
chapter,xlv,elinor,for,some,time,after,he,left,her,for,some
time,even,after,the,sound,of,his,carriage,had,died,away,remained
too,much,oppressed,by,a,crowd,of,ideas,widely,differing,in,themselves
but,of,which,sadness,was,the,general,result,to,think,even,of
hersister
willoughby,he,whom,only,half,an,hour,ago,she,had,abhorred,as
the,most,worthless,of,men,willoughby,in,spite,of,all,his,faults
excited,a,degree,of,commiseration,for,the,sufferings,produced,by,them,which
made,her,think,of,him,as,now,separated,for,ever,from,her
family,with,a,tenderness,a,regret,rather,in,proportion,as,she,soon
acknowledged,within,herself,to,his,wishes,than,to,hismerits
she,felt,that,his,influence,over,her,mind,was,heightened,by,circumstances
which,ought,not,in,reason,to,have,weight,by,that,person,of
uncommon,attraction,that,open,affectionate,and,lively,manner,which,it,was,no
merit,to,possess,and,by,that,still,ardent,love,for,marianne,which
it,was,not,even,innocent,toindulge
but,she,felt,that,it,was,so,long,long,before,she,could
feel,his,influenceless
when,at,last,she,returned,to,the,unconscious,marianne,she,found,her
just,awaking,refreshed,by,so,long,and,sweet,a,sleep,to,the
extent,of,herhopes
elinor,s,heart,wasfull
the,past,the,present,the,future,willoughby,s,visit,marianne,s,safety
and,her,mother,s,expected,arrival,threw,her,altogether,into,an,agitation
of,spirits,which,kept,off,every,indication,of,fatigue,and,made,her
only,fearful,of,betraying,herself,to,hersister
short,was,the,time,however,in,which,that,fear,could,affect,her
for,within,half,an,hour,after,willoughby,s,leaving,the,house,she
was,again,called,down,stairs,by,the,sound,of,anothercarriage
eager,to,save,her,mother,from,every,unnecessary,moment,s,horrible,suspense
she,ran,immediately,into,the,hall,and,reached,the,outward,door,just
in,time,to,receive,and,support,her,as,she,enteredit
mrs,dashwood,whose,terror,as,they,drew,near,the,house,had,produced
almost,the,conviction,of,marianne,s,being,no,more,had,no,voice
to,inquire,after,her,no,voice,even,for,elinor,but,_she_,waiting
neither,for,salutation,nor,inquiry,instantly,gave,the,joyful,relief,and,her
mother,catching,it,with,all,her,usual,warmth,was,in,a,moment
as,much,overcome,by,her,happiness,as,she,had,been,before,by
herfears
she,was,supported,into,the,drawing,room,between,her,daughter,and,her
friend,and,there,shedding,tears,of,joy,though,still,unable,to,speak
embraced,elinor,again,and,again,turning,from,her,at,intervals,to,press
colonel,brandon,s,hand,with,a,look,which,spoke,at,once,her
gratitude,and,her,conviction,of,his,sharing,with,herself,in,the,bliss
of,themoment
he,shared,it,however,in,a,silence,even,greater,than,herown
as,soon,as,mrs,dashwood,had,recovered,herself,to,see,marianne,was
her,first,desire,and,in,two,minutes,she,was,with,her,beloved
child,rendered,dearer,to,her,than,ever,by,absence,unhappiness,anddanger
elinor,s,delight,as,she,saw,what,each,felt,in,the,meeting
was,only,checked,by,an,apprehension,of,its,robbing,marianne,of,farther
sleep,but,mrs,dashwood,could,be,calm,could,be,even,prudent,when
the,life,of,a,child,was,at,stake,and,marianne,satisfied,in
knowing,her,mother,was,near,her,and,conscious,of,being,too,weak
for,conversation,submitted,readily,to,the,silence,and,quiet,prescribed,by,every
nurse,aroundher
mrs,dashwood,_would_,sit,up,with,her,all,night,and,elinor,in
compliance,with,her,mother,s,entreaty,went,tobed
but,the,rest,which,one,night,entirely,sleepless,and,many,hours,of
the,most,wearing,anxiety,seemed,to,make,requisite,was,kept,off,by
irritation,ofspirits
willoughby,poor,willoughby,as,she,now,allowed,herself,to,call,him,was
constantly,in,her,thoughts,she,would,not,but,have,heard,his,vindication
for,the,world,and,now,blamed,now,acquitted,herself,for,having,judged
him,so,harshlybefore
but,her,promise,of,relating,it,to,her,sister,was,invariablypainful
she,dreaded,the,performance,of,it,dreaded,what,its,effect,on,marianne
might,be,doubted,whether,after,such,an,explanation,she,could,ever,be
happy,with,another,and,for,a,moment,wished,willoughby,awidower
then,remembering,colonel,brandon,reproved,herself,felt,that,to,_his_,sufferings,and
_his_,constancy,far,more,than,to,his,rival,s,the,reward,of
her,sister,was,due,and,wished,any,thing,rather,than,mrs,willoughby
sdeath
the,shock,of,colonel,brandon,s,errand,at,barton,had,been,much
softened,to,mrs,dashwood,by,her,own,previous,alarm,for,so,great
was,her,uneasiness,about,marianne,that,she,had,already,determined,to,set
out,for,cleveland,on,that,very,day,without,waiting,for,any,further
intelligence,and,had,so,far,settled,her,journey,before,his,arrival,that
the,careys,were,then,expected,every,moment,to,fetch,margaret,away,as
her,mother,was,unwilling,to,take,her,where,there,might,beinfection
marianne,continued,to,mend,every,day,and,the,brilliant,cheerfulness,of,mrs
dashwood,s,looks,and,spirits,proved,her,to,be,as,she,repeatedly
declared,herself,one,of,the,happiest,women,in,theworld
elinor,could,not,hear,the,declaration,nor,witness,its,proofs,without,sometimes
wondering,whether,her,mother,ever,recollectededward
but,mrs,dashwood,trusting,to,the,temperate,account,of,her,own,disappointment
which,elinor,had,sent,her,was,led,away,by,the,exuberance,of
her,joy,to,think,only,of,what,would,increaseit
marianne,was,restored,to,her,from,a,danger,in,which,as,she
now,began,to,feel,her,own,mistaken,judgment,in,encouraging,the,unfortunate
attachment,to,willoughby,had,contributed,to,place,her,and,in,her,recovery
she,had,yet,another,source,of,joy,unthought,of,byelinor
it,was,thus,imparted,to,her,as,soon,as,any,opportunity,of
private,conference,between,themoccurred
at,last,we,arealone
my,elinor,you,do,not,yet,know,all,myhappiness
colonel,brandon,lovesmarianne
he,has,told,me,sohimself
her,daughter,feeling,by,turns,both,pleased,and,pained,surprised,and,not
surprised,was,all,silentattention
you,are,never,like,me,dear,elinor,or,i,should,wonder,at
your,composurenow
had,i,sat,down,to,wish,for,any,possible,good,to,my

you,as,the,object,mostdesirable
and,i,believe,marianne,will,be,the,most,happy,with,him,of
thetwo
elinor,was,half,inclined,to,ask,her,reason,for,thinking,so,because
satisfied,that,none,founded,on,an,impartial,consideration,of,their,age,characters
or,feelings,could,be,given,but,her,mother,must,always,be,carried
away,by,her,imagination,on,any,interesting,subject,and,therefore,instead,of
an,inquiry,she,passed,it,off,with,asmile
he,opened,his,whole,heart,to,me,yesterday,as,wetravelled
it,came,out,quite,unawares,quiteundesignedly
i,you,may,well,believe,could,talk,of,nothing,but,my,child
he,could,not,conceal,his,distress,i,saw,that,it,equalled,my
own,and,he,perhaps,thinking,that,mere,friendship,as,the,world,now
goes,would,not,justify,so,warm,a,sympathy,or,rather,not,thinking
at,all,i,suppose,giving,way,to,irresistible,feelings,made,me,acquainted
with,his,earnest,tender,constant,affection,formarianne
he,has,loved,her,my,elinor,ever,since,the,first,moment,of
seeingher
here,however,elinor,perceived,not,the,language,not,the,professions,of,colonel
brandon,but,the,natural,embellishments,of,her,mother,s,active,fancy,which
fashioned,every,thing,delightful,to,her,as,itchose
his,regard,for,her,infinitely,surpassing,anything,that,willoughby,ever,felt,or
feigned,as,much,more,warm,as,more,sincere,or,constant,which,ever
we,are,to,call,it,has,subsisted,through,all,the,knowledge,of
dear,marianne,s,unhappy,prepossession,for,that,worthless,youngman
and,without,selfishness,without,encouraging,ahope
could,he,have,seen,her,happy,withanother
such,a,noblemind
such,openness,suchsincerity
no,one,can,be,deceived,in,_him,_,colonel,brandon,s,character
said,elinor,as,an,excellent,man,is,wellestablished
i,know,it,is,replied,her,mother,seriously,or,after,such,a
warning,i,should,be,the,last,to,encourage,such,affection,or,even
to,be,pleased,byit
but,his,coming,for,me,as,he,did,with,such,active,such
ready,friendship,is,enough,to,prove,him,one,of,the,worthiest,of
men
his,character,however,answered,elinor,does,not,rest,on,_one_,act,of
kindness,to,which,his,affection,for,marianne,were,humanity,out,of,the
case,would,have,promptedhim
to,mrs,jennings,to,the,middletons,he,has,been,long,and,intimately
known,they,equally,love,and,respect,him,and,even,my,own,knowledge
of,him,though,lately,acquired,is,very,considerable,and,so,highly,do
i,value,and,esteem,him,that,if,marianne,can,be,happy,with
him,i,shall,be,as,ready,as,yourself,to,think,our,connection
the,greatest,blessing,to,us,in,theworld
what,answer,did,you,givehim
did,you,allow,him,tohope
oh
my,love,i,could,not,then,talk,of,hope,to,him,or
tomyself
marianne,might,at,that,moment,bedying
but,he,did,not,ask,for,hope,orencouragement
his,was,an,involuntary,confidence,an,irrepressible,effusion,to,a,soothing,friend
not,an,application,to,aparent
yet,after,a,time,i,_did_,say,for,at,first,i,was
quite,overcome,that,if,she,lived,as,i,trusted,she,might,my
greatest,happiness,would,lie,in,promoting,their,marriage,and,since,our,arrival
since,our,delightful,security,i,have,repeated,it,to,him,more,fully
have,given,him,every,encouragement,in,mypower
time,a,very,little,time,i,tell,him,will,do,everything,marianne
s,heart,is,not,to,be,wasted,for,ever,on,such,a
man,aswilloughby
his,own,merits,must,soon,secureit
to,judge,from,the,colonel,s,spirits,however,you,have,not,yet
made,him,equallysanguine
no
he,thinks,marianne,s,affection,too,deeply,rooted,for,any,change,in
it,under,a,great,length,of,time,and,even,supposing,her,heart
again,free,is,too,diffident,of,himself,to,believe,that,with,such
a,difference,of,age,and,disposition,he,could,ever,attachher
there,however,he,is,quitemistaken
his,age,is,only,so,much,beyond,hers,as,to,be,an
advantage,as,to,make,his,character,and,principles,fixed,and,his,disposition
i,am,well,convinced,is,exactly,the,very,one,to,make,your
sisterhappy
and,his,person,his,manners,too,are,all,in,hisfavour
my,partiality,does,not,blind,me,he,certainly,is,not,so,handsome
as,willoughby,but,at,the,same,time,there,is,something,much,more
pleasing,in,hiscountenance
there,was,always,a,something,if,you,remember,in,willoughby,s,eyes
at,times,which,i,did,notlike
elinor,could,_not_,remember,it,but,her,mother,without,waiting,for,her
assent,continued,and,his,manners,the,colonel,s,manners,are,not,only
more,pleasing,to,me,than,willoughby,s,ever,were,but,they,are
of,a,kind,i,well,know,to,be,more,solidly,attaching,to
marianne
their,gentleness,their,genuine,attention,to,other,people,and,their,manly,unstudied
simplicity,is,much,more,accordant,with,her,real,disposition,than,the,liveliness
often,artificial,and,often,ill,timed,of,theother
i,am,very,sure,myself,that,had,willoughby,turned,out,as,really
amiable,as,he,has,proved,himself,the,contrary,marianne,would,yet,never
have,been,so,happy,with,_him_,as,she,will,be,with,colonel
brandon
shepaused
her,daughter,could,not,quite,agree,with,her,but,her,dissent,was
not,heard,and,therefore,gave,nooffence
at,delaford,she,will,be,within,an,easy,distance,of,me,added
mrs,dashwood,even,if,i,remain,at,barton,and,in,all,probability
for,i,hear,it,is,a,large,village,indeed,there,certainly,_must_
be,some,small,house,or,cottage,close,by,that,would,suit,us
quite,as,well,as,our,presentsituation
poor,elinor,here,was,a,new,scheme,for,getting,her,to,delaford
but,her,spirit,wasstubborn
his,fortune,too,for,at,my,time,of,life,you,know,everybody
cares,about,_that_,and,though,i,neither,know,nor,desire,to,know
what,it,really,is,i,am,sure,it,must,be,a,good
one
here,they,were,interrupted,by,the,entrance,of,a,third,person,and
elinor,withdrew,to,think,it,all,over,in,private,to,wish,success
to,her,friend,and,yet,in,wishing,it,to,feel,a,pang
forwilloughby
chapter,xlvi,marianne,s,illness,though,weakening,in,its,kind,had,not
been,long,enough,to,make,her,recovery,slow,and,with,youth,natural
strength,and,her,mother,s,presence,in,aid,it,proceeded,so,smoothly
as,to,enable,her,to,remove,within,four,days,after,the,arrival
of,the,latter,into,mrs,palmer,s,dressingroom
when,there,at,her,own,particular,request,for,she,was,impatient,to
pour,forth,her,thanks,to,him,for,fetching,her,mother,colonel,brandon
was,invited,to,visither
his,emotion,on,entering,the,room,in,seeing,her,altered,looks,and
in,receiving,the,pale,hand,which,she,immediately,held,out,to,him
was,such,as,in,elinor,s,conjecture,must,arise,from,something,more
than,his,affection,for,marianne,or,the,consciousness,of,its,being,known
to,others,and,she,soon,discovered,in,his,melancholy,eye,and,varying
complexion,as,he,looked,at,her,sister,the,probable,recurrence,of,many

mrs,dashwood,and,elinor,then,followed,and,the,others,were,left,by
themselves,to,talk,of,the,travellers,and,feel,their,own,dullness,till
mrs,jennings,was,summoned,to,her,chaise,to,take,comfort,in,the
gossip,of,her,maid,for,the,loss,of,her,two,young,companions
and,colonel,brandon,immediately,afterwards,took,his,solitary,way,todelaford
the,dashwoods,were,two,days,on,the,road,and,marianne,bore,her
journey,on,both,without,essentialfatigue
every,thing,that,the,most,zealous,affection,the,most,solicitous,care,could
do,to,render,her,comfortable,was,the,office,of,each,watchful,companion
and,each,found,their,reward,in,her,bodily,ease,and,her,calmness
ofspirits
to,elinor,the,observation,of,the,latter,was,particularlygrateful
she,who,had,seen,her,week,after,week,so,constantly,suffering,oppressed
by,anguish,of,heart,which,she,had,neither,courage,to,speak,of
nor,fortitude,to,conceal,now,saw,with,a,joy,which,no,other
could,equally,share,an,apparent,composure,of,mind,which,in,being,the
result,as,she,trusted,of,serious,reflection,must,eventually,lead,her,to
contentment,andcheerfulness
as,they,approached,barton,indeed,and,entered,on,scenes,of,which,every
field,and,every,tree,brought,some,peculiar,some,painful,recollection,she,grew
silent,and,thoughtful,and,turning,away,her,face,from,their,notice,sat
earnestly,gazing,through,thewindow
but,here,elinor,could,neither,wonder,nor,blame,and,when,she,saw
as,she,assisted,marianne,from,the,carriage,that,she,had,been,crying
she,saw,only,an,emotion,too,natural,in,itself,to,raise,any
thing,less,tender,than,pity,and,in,its,unobtrusiveness,entitled,topraise
in,the,whole,of,her,subsequent,manner,she,traced,the,direction,of
a,mind,awakened,to,reasonable,exertion,for,no,sooner,had,they,entered
their,common,sitting,room,than,marianne,turned,her,eyes,around,it,with
a,look,of,resolute,firmness,as,if,determined,at,once,to,accustom
herself,to,the,sight,of,every,object,with,which,the,remembrance,of
willoughby,could,beconnected
she,said,little,but,every,sentence,aimed,at,cheerfulness,and,though,a
sigh,sometimes,escaped,her,it,never,passed,away,without,the,atonement,of
asmile
after,dinner,she,would,try,her,pianoforte
she,went,to,it,but,the,music,on,which,her,eye,first
rested,was,an,opera,procured,for,her,by,willoughby,containing,some,of
their,favourite,duets,and,bearing,on,its,outward,leaf,her,own,name
in,his,handwriting
that,would,notdo
she,shook,her,head,put,the,music,aside,and,after,running,over
the,keys,for,a,minute,complained,of,feebleness,in,her,fingers,and
closed,the,instrument,again,declaring,however,with,firmness,as,she,did,so
that,she,should,in,future,practicemuch
the,next,morning,produced,no,abatement,in,these,happysymptoms
on,the,contrary,with,a,mind,and,body,alike,strengthened,by,rest
she,looked,and,spoke,with,more,genuine,spirit,anticipating,the,pleasure,of
margaret,s,return,and,talking,of,the,dear,family,party,which,would
then,be,restored,of,their,mutual,pursuits,and,cheerful,society,as,the
only,happiness,worth,awish
when,the,weather,is,settled,and,i,have,recovered,my,strength,said
she,we,will,take,long,walks,together,everyday
we,will,walk,to,the,farm,at,the,edge,of,the,down
and,see,how,the,children,go,on,we,will,walk,to,sir
john,s,new,plantations,at,barton,cross,and,the,abbeyland,and,we
will,often,go,the,old,ruins,of,the,priory,and,try,to

there,are,others,of,more,modern,production,which,i,know,i,can
borrow,of,colonelbrandon
by,reading,only,six,hours,a,day,i,shall,gain,in,the

virtuous,selfcontrol
her,smile,however,changed,to,a,sigh,when,she,remembered,that,promise
to,willoughby,was,yet,unfulfilled,and,feared,she,had,that,to,communicate
which,might,again,unsettle,the,mind,of,marianne,and,ruin,at,least
for,a,time,this,fair,prospect,of,busytranquillity
willing,therefore,to,delay,the,evil,hour,she,resolved,to,wait,till

the,daughter,s,wishes,and,the,mother,s,confidence,and,marianne,leaning
on,elinor,s,arm,was,authorised,to,walk,as,long,as,she

her,away,to,forget,that,in,elinor,she,might,have,a,daughter

chapter,xlviii,elinor,now,found,the,difference,between,the,expectation,of,an
unpleasant,event,however,certain,the,mind,may,be,told,to,consider,it
and,certaintyitself
she,now,found,that,in,spite,of,herself,she,had,always,admitted
a,hope,while,edward,remained,single,that,something,would,occur,to,prevent
his,marrying,lucy,that,some,resolution,of,his,own,some,mediation,of
friends,or,some,more,eligible,opportunity,of,establishment,for,the,lady,would
arise,to,assist,the,happiness,ofall

without,saying,a,word,quitted,the,room,and,walked,out,towards,the
village,leaving,the,others,in,the,greatest,astonishment,and,perplexity,on,a
change,in,his,situation,so,wonderful,and,so,sudden,a,perplexity,which
they,had,no,means,of,lessening,but,by,their,ownconjectures
chapter,xlix,unaccountable,however,as,the,circumstances,of,his,release,might,appear
to,the,whole,family,it,was,certain,that,edward,was,free,and
to,what,purpose,that,freedom,would,be,employed,was,easily,pre,determined
by,all,for,after,experiencing,the,blessings,of,_one_,imprudent,engagement,contracted
without,his,mother,s,consent,as,he,had,already,done,for,more
than,four,years,nothing,less,could,be,expected,of,him,in,the

his,errand,at,barton,in,fact,was,a,simpleone

he,really,did,so,much,in,need,of,encouragement,and,freshair
how,soon,he,had,walked,himself,into,the,proper,resolution,however,how
soon,an,opportunity,of,exercising,it,occurred,in,what,manner,he,expressed
himself,and,how,he,was,received,need,not,be,particularlytold
this,only,need,be,said,that,when,they,all,sat,down,to
table,at,four,o,clock,about,three,hours,after,his,arrival,he
had,secured,his,lady,engaged,her,mother,s,consent,and,was,not
only,in,the,rapturous,profession,of,the,lover,but,in,the,reality
of,reason,and,truth,one,of,the,happiest,ofmen
his,situation,indeed,was,more,than,commonlyjoyful
he,had,more,than,the,ordinary,triumph,of,accepted,love,to,swell
his,heart,and,raise,hisspirits
he,was,released,without,any,reproach,to,himself,from,an,entanglement,which
had,long,formed,his,misery,from,a,woman,whom,he,had,long
ceased,to,love,and,elevated,at,once,to,that,security,with,another
which,he,must,have,thought,of,almost,with,despair,as,soon,as
he,had,learnt,to,consider,it,withdesire
he,was,brought,not,from,doubt,or,suspense,but,from,misery,to
happiness,and,the,change,was,openly,spoken,in,such,a,genuine,flowing

his,heart,was,now,open,to,elinor,all,its,weaknesses,all,its
errors,confessed,and,his,first,boyish,attachment,to,lucy,treated,with,all
the,philosophic,dignity,of,twentyfour

i,had,not,even,the,nominal,employment,which,belonging,to,the,university
would,have,given,me,for,i,was,not,entered,at,oxford,till

i,had,therefore,nothing,in,the,world,to,do,but,to,fancy

in,every,respect,comfortable,as,i,had,no,friend,no,companion,in
my,brother,and,disliked,new,acquaintance,it,was,not,unnatural,for,me
to,be,very,often,at,longstaple,where,i,always,felt,myself,at

edward,was,now,fixed,at,the,cottage,at,least,for,a,week
for,whatever,other,claims,might,be,made,on,him,it,was,impossible
that,less,than,a,week,should,be,given,up,to,the,enjoyment
of,elinor,s,company,or,suffice,to,say,half,that,was,to
be,said,of,the,past,the,present,and,the,future,for,though

of,course,one,of,the,earliest,discussions,of,the,lovers,and,elinor
s,particular,knowledge,of,each,party,made,it,appear,to,her,in
every,view,as,one,of,the,most,extraordinary,and,unaccountable,circumstances,she
had,everheard
how,they,could,be,thrown,together,and,by,what,attraction,robert,could
be,drawn,on,to,marry,a,girl,of,whose,beauty,she,had
herself,heard,him,speak,without,any,admiration,a,girl,too,already,engaged
to,his,brother,and,on,whose,account,that,brother,had,been,thrown
off,by,his,family,it,was,beyond,her,comprehension,to,makeout
to,her,own,heart,it,was,a,delightful,affair,to,her,imagination
it,was,even,a,ridiculous,one,but,to,her,reason,her,judgment
it,was,completely,apuzzle
edward,could,only,attempt,an,explanation,by,supposing,that,perhaps,at,first
accidentally,meeting,the,vanity,of,the,one,had,been,so,worked,on
by,the,flattery,of,the,other,as,to,lead,by,degrees,to
all,therest
elinor,remembered,what,robert,had,told,her,in,harley,street,of,his
opinion,of,what,his,own,mediation,in,his,brother,s,affairs,might
have,done,if,applied,to,intime
she,repeated,it,toedward
_that_,was,exactly,like,robert,was,his,immediateobservation
and,_that_,he,presently,added,might,perhaps,be,in,_his_,head,when
the,acquaintance,between,them,firstbegan
and,lucy,perhaps,at,first,might,think,only,of,procuring,his,good
offices,in,myfavour
other,designs,might,afterwardarise
how,long,it,had,been,carrying,on,between,them,however,he,was
equally,at,a,loss,with,herself,to,make,out,for,at,oxford
where,he,had,remained,for,choice,ever,since,his,quitting,london,he
had,had,no,means,of,hearing,of,her,but,from,herself,and
her,letters,to,the,very,last,were,neither,less,frequent,nor,less
affectionate,thanusual
not,the,smallest,suspicion,therefore,had,ever,occurred,to,prepare,him,for
what,followed,and,when,at,last,it,burst,on,him,in,a
letter,from,lucy,herself,he,had,been,for,some,time,he,believed
half,stupified,between,the,wonder,the,horror,and,the,joy,of,such
adeliverance
he,put,the,letter,into,elinor,shands

edward
for,worlds,would,not,i,have,had,a,letter,of,hers,seen
by,_you_,in,formerdays
in,a,sister,it,is,bad,enough,but,in,awife
how,i,have,blushed,over,the,pages,of,herwriting
and,i,believe,i,may,say,that,since,the,first,half,year
of,our,foolish,business,this,is,the,only,letter,i,ever,received
from,her,of,which,the,substance,made,me,any,amends,for,the
defect,of,thestyle
however,it,may,have,come,about,said,elinor,after,a,pause,they
are,certainlymarried
and,your,mother,has,brought,on,herself,a,most,appropriatepunishment
the,independence,she,settled,on,robert,through,resentment,against,you,has,put
it,in,his,power,to,make,his,own,choice,and,she,has
actually,been,bribing,one,son,with,a,thousand,a,year,to,do
the,very,deed,which,she,disinherited,the,other,for,intending,todo
she,will,hardly,be,less,hurt,i,suppose,by,robert,s,marrying
lucy,than,she,would,have,been,by,your,marryingher
she,will,be,more,hurt,by,it,for,robert,always,was,her
favourite
she,will,be,more,hurt,by,it,and,on,the,same,principle
will,forgive,him,muchsooner
in,what,state,the,affair,stood,at,present,between,them,edward,knew
not,for,no,communication,with,any,of,his,family,had,yet,been
attempted,byhim
he,had,quitted,oxford,within,four,and,twenty,hours,after,lucy,s
letter,arrived,and,with,only,one,object,before,him,the,nearest,road
to,barton,had,had,no,leisure,to,form,any,scheme,of,conduct
with,which,that,road,did,not,hold,the,most,intimateconnection
he,could,do,nothing,till,he,were,assured,of,his,fate,with
miss,dashwood,and,by,his,rapidity,in,seeking,_that_,fate,it,is
to,be,supposed,in,spite,of,the,jealousy,with,which,he,had
once,thought,of,colonel,brandon,in,spite,of,the,modesty,with,which
he,rated,his,own,deserts,and,the,politeness,with,which,he,talked
of,his,doubts,he,did,not,upon,the,whole,expect,a,very
cruelreception
it,was,his,business,however,to,say,that,he,_did_,and,he
said,it,veryprettily
what,he,might,say,on,the,subject,a,twelvemonth,after,must,be
referred,to,the,imagination,of,husbands,andwives
that,lucy,had,certainly,meant,to,deceive,to,go,off,with,a
flourish,of,malice,against,him,in,her,message,by,thomas,was,perfectly
clear,to,elinor,and,edward,himself,now,thoroughly,enlightened,on,her,character
had,no,scruple,in,believing,her,capable,of,the,utmost,meanness,of
wanton,illnature
though,his,eyes,had,been,long,opened,even,before,his,acquaintance,with
elinor,began,to,her,ignorance,and,a,want,of,liberality,in,some
of,her,opinions,they,had,been,equally,imputed,by,him,to,her
want,of,education,and,till,her,last,letter,reached,him,he,had
always,believed,her,to,be,a,well,disposed,good,hearted,girl,and
thoroughly,attached,tohimself
nothing,but,such,a,persuasion,could,have,prevented,his,putting,an,end
to,an,engagement,which,long,before,the,discovery,of,it,laid,him
open,to,his,mother,s,anger,had,been,a,continual,source,of
disquiet,and,regret,tohim
i,thought,it,my,duty,said,he,independent,of,my,feelings,to
give,her,the,option,of,continuing,the,engagement,or,not,when,i
was,renounced,by,my,mother,and,stood,to,all,appearance,without,a
friend,in,the,world,to,assistme
in,such,a,situation,as,that,where,there,seemed,nothing,to,tempt
the,avarice,or,the,vanity,of,any,living,creature,how,could,i
suppose,when,she,so,earnestly,so,warmly,insisted,on,sharing,my,fate
whatever,it,might,be,that,any,thing,but,the,most,disinterested,affection
was,herinducement
and,even,now,i,cannot,comprehend,on,what,motive,she,acted,or
what,fancied,advantage,it,could,be,to,her,to,be,fettered,to
a,man,for,whom,she,had,not,the,smallest,regard,and,who
had,only,two,thousand,pounds,in,theworld
she,could,not,foresee,that,colonel,brandon,would,give,me,aliving
no,but,she,might,suppose,that,something,would,occur,in,your,favour
that,your,own,family,might,in,timerelent
and,at,any,rate,she,lost,nothing,by,continuing,the,engagement,for
she,has,proved,that,it,fettered,neither,her,inclination,nor,heractions
the,connection,was,certainly,a,respectable,one,and,probably,gained,her,consideration
among,her,friends,and,if,nothing,more,advantageous,occurred,it,would,be
better,for,her,to,marry,_you_,than,besingle
edward,was,of,course,immediately,convinced,that,nothing,could,have,been,more
natural,than,lucy,s,conduct,nor,more,self,evident,than,the,motive
ofit
elinor,scolded,him,harshly,as,ladies,always,scold,the,imprudence,which,compliments
themselves,for,having,spent,so,much,time,with,them,at,norland,when
he,must,have,felt,his,owninconstancy
your,behaviour,was,certainly,very,wrong,said,she,because,to,say,nothing
of,my,own,conviction,our,relations,were,all,led,away,by,it
to,fancy,and,expect,_what_,as,you,were,_then_,situated,could,never
be
he,could,only,plead,an,ignorance,of,his,own,heart,and,a
mistaken,confidence,in,the,force,of,hisengagement
i,was,simple,enough,to,think,that,because,my,_faith_,was,plighted
to,another,there,could,be,no,danger,in,my,being,with,you
and,that,the,consciousness,of,my,engagement,was,to,keep,my,heart
as,safe,and,sacred,as,myhonour
i,felt,that,i,admired,you,but,i,told,myself,it,was
only,friendship,and,till,i,began,to,make,comparisons,between,yourself,and
lucy,i,did,not,know,how,far,i,wasgot
after,that,i,suppose,i,_was_,wrong,in,remaining,so,much,in
sussex,and,the,arguments,with,which,i,reconciled,myself,to,the,expediency
of,it,were,no,better,than,these,the,danger,is,my,own
i,am,doing,no,injury,to,anybody,butmyself
elinor,smiled,and,shook,herhead
edward,heard,with,pleasure,of,colonel,brandon,s,being,expected,at,the
cottage,as,he,really,wished,not,only,to,be,better,acquainted,with
him,but,to,have,an,opportunity,of,convincing,him,that,he,no
longer,resented,his,giving,him,the,living,of,delaford,which,at,present
said,he,after,thanks,so,ungraciously,delivered,as,mine,were,on,the
occasion,he,must,think,i,have,never,forgiven,him,foroffering
_now_,he,felt,astonished,himself,that,he,had,never,yet,been,to
theplace
but,so,little,interest,had,he,taken,in,the,matter,that,he
owed,all,his,knowledge,of,the,house,garden,and,glebe,extent,of
the,parish,condition,of,the,land,and,rate,of,the,tithes,to
elinor,herself,who,had,heard,so,much,of,it,from,colonel,brandon
and,heard,it,with,so,much,attention,as,to,be,entirely,mistress
of,thesubject
one,question,after,this,only,remained,undecided,between,them,one,difficulty,only
was,to,beovercome
they,were,brought,together,by,mutual,affection,with,the,warmest,approbation,of
their,real,friends,their,intimate,knowledge,of,each,other,seemed,to,make
their,happiness,certain,and,they,only,wanted,something,to,liveupon
edward,had,two,thousand,pounds,and,elinor,one,which,with,delaford,living
was,all,that,they,could,call,their,own,for,it,was,impossible
that,mrs,dashwood,should,advance,anything,and,they,were,neither,of,them
quite,enough,in,love,to,think,that,three,hundred,and,fifty,pounds
a,year,would,supply,them,with,the,comforts,oflife
edward,was,not,entirely,without,hopes,of,some,favourable,change,in,his
mother,towards,him,and,on,_that_,he,rested,for,the,residue,of
theirincome
but,elinor,had,no,such,dependence,for,since,edward,would,still,be
unable,to,marry,miss,morton,and,his,choosing,herself,had,been,spoken
of,in,mrs,ferrars,s,flattering,language,as,only,a,lesser,evil
than,his,choosing,lucy,steele,she,feared,that,robert,s,offence,would
serve,no,other,purpose,than,to,enrichfanny
about,four,days,after,edward,s,arrival,colonel,brandon,appeared,to,complete
mrs,dashwood,s,satisfaction,and,to,give,her,the,dignity,of,having
for,the,first,time,since,her,living,at,barton,more,company,with
her,than,her,house,wouldhold
edward,was,allowed,to,retain,the,privilege,of,first,comer,and,colonel
brandon,therefore,walked,every,night,to,his,old,quarters,at,the,park
from,whence,he,usually,returned,in,the,morning,early,enough,to,interrupt
the,lovers,first,tête,à,tête,beforebreakfast
a,three,weeks,residence,at,delaford,where,in,his,evening,hours,at
least,he,had,little,to,do,but,to,calculate,the,disproportion,between
thirty,six,and,seventeen,brought,him,to,barton,in,a,temper,of
mind,which,needed,all,the,improvement,in,marianne,s,looks,all,the
kindness,of,her,welcome,and,all,the,encouragement,of,her,mother,s
language,to,make,itcheerful
among,such,friends,however,and,such,flattery,he,didrevive
no,rumour,of,lucy,s,marriage,had,yet,reached,him,he,knew
nothing,of,what,had,passed,and,the,first,hours,of,his,visit
were,consequently,spent,in,hearing,and,inwondering
every,thing,was,explained,to,him,by,mrs,dashwood,and,he,found
fresh,reason,to,rejoice,in,what,he,had,done,for,mr,ferrars
since,eventually,it,promoted,the,interest,ofelinor
it,would,be,needless,to,say,that,the,gentlemen,advanced,in,the
good,opinion,of,each,other,as,they,advanced,in,each,other,s
acquaintance,for,it,could,not,beotherwise
their,resemblance,in,good,principles,and,good,sense,in,disposition,and,manner
of,thinking,would,probably,have,been,sufficient,to,unite,them,in,friendship
without,any,other,attraction,but,their,being,in,love,with,two,sisters
and,two,sisters,fond,of,each,other,made,that,mutual,regard,inevitable
and,immediate,which,might,otherwise,have,waited,the,effect,of,time,and
judgment
the,letters,from,town,which,a,few,days,before,would,have,made
every,nerve,in,elinor,s,body,thrill,with,transport,now,arrived,to
be,read,with,less,emotion,thanmirth
mrs,jennings,wrote,to,tell,the,wonderful,tale,to,vent,her,honest
indignation,against,the,jilting,girl,and,pour,forth,her,compassion,towards,poor
mr,edward,who,she,was,sure,had,quite,doted,upon,the,worthless
hussy,and,was,now,by,all,accounts,almost,broken,hearted,atoxford
i,do,think,she,continued,nothing,was,ever,carried,on,so,sly
for,it,was,but,two,days,before,lucy,called,and,sat,a
couple,of,hours,withme
not,a,soul,suspected,anything,of,the,matter,not,even,nancy,who
poorsoul
came,crying,to,me,the,day,after,in,a,great,fright,for
fear,of,mrs,ferrars,as,well,as,not,knowing,how,to,get
to,plymouth,for,lucy,it,seems,borrowed,all,her,money,before,she
went,off,to,be,married,on,purpose,we,suppose,to,make,a
show,with,and,poor,nancy,had,not,seven,shillings,in,the,world
so,i,was,very,glad,to,give,her,five,guineas,to,take
her,down,to,exeter,where,she,thinks,of,staying,three,or,four
weeks,with,mrs,burgess,in,hopes,as,i,tell,her,to,fall
in,with,the,doctoragain
and,i,must,say,that,lucy,s,crossness,not,to,take,them
along,with,them,in,the,chaise,is,worse,thanall
poor,mredward
i,cannot,get,him,out,of,my,head,but,you,must,send
for,him,to,barton,and,miss,marianne,must,try,to,comforthim
mr,dashwood,s,strains,were,moresolemn
mrs,ferrars,was,the,most,unfortunate,of,women,poor,fanny,had,suffered
agonies,of,sensibility,and,he,considered,the,existence,of,each,under,such
a,blow,with,gratefulwonder
robert,s,offence,was,unpardonable,but,lucy,s,was,infinitelyworse
neither,of,them,were,ever,again,to,be,mentioned,to,mrs,ferrars
and,even,if,she,might,hereafter,be,induced,to,forgive,her,son
his,wife,should,never,be,acknowledged,as,her,daughter,nor,be,permitted
to,appear,in,herpresence
the,secrecy,with,which,everything,had,been,carried,on,between,them,was
rationally,treated,as,enormously,heightening,the,crime,because,had,any,suspicion,of
it,occurred,to,the,others,proper,measures,would,have,been,taken,to
prevent,the,marriage,and,he,called,on,elinor,to,join,with,him
in,regretting,that,lucy,s,engagement,with,edward,had,not,rather,been
fulfilled,than,that,she,should,thus,be,the,means,of,spreading,misery
farther,in,thefamily
he,thus,continued,mrs,ferrars,has,never,yet,mentioned,edward,s,name
which,does,not,surprise,us,but,to,our,great,astonishment,not,a
line,has,been,received,from,him,on,theoccasion
perhaps,however,he,is,kept,silent,by,his,fear,of,offending,and
i,shall,therefore,give,him,a,hint,by,a,line,to,oxford
that,his,sister,and,i,both,think,a,letter,of,proper,submission
from,him,addressed,perhaps,to,fanny,and,by,her,shown,to,her
mother,might,not,be,taken,amiss,for,we,all,know,the,tenderness
of,mrs,ferrars,s,heart,and,that,she,wishes,for,nothing,so
much,as,to,be,on,good,terms,with,herchildren
this,paragraph,was,of,some,importance,to,the,prospects,and,conduct,of
edward
it,determined,him,to,attempt,a,reconciliation,though,not,exactly,in,the
manner,pointed,out,by,their,brother,andsister
a,letter,of,propersubmission
repeated,he,would,they,have,me,beg,my,mother,s,pardon,for
robert,s,ingratitude,to,_her_,and,breach,of,honour,to_me_
i,can,make,nosubmission
i,am,grown,neither,humble,nor,penitent,by,what,haspassed
i,am,grown,very,happy,but,that,would,notinterest
i,know,of,no,submission,that,_is_,proper,for,me,tomake
you,may,certainly,ask,to,be,forgiven,said,elinor,because,you,have
offended,and,i,should,think,you,might,_now_,venture,so,far,as
to,profess,some,concern,for,having,ever,formed,the,engagement,which,drew
on,you,your,mother,sanger
he,agreed,that,hemight
and,when,she,has,forgiven,you,perhaps,a,little,humility,may,be
convenient,while,acknowledging,a,second,engagement,almost,as,imprudent,in,_her_,eyes
as,thefirst
he,had,nothing,to,urge,against,it,but,still,resisted,the,idea
of,a,letter,of,proper,submission,and,therefore,to,make,it,easier
to,him,as,he,declared,a,much,greater,willingness,to,make,mean
concessions,by,word,of,mouth,than,on,paper,it,was,resolved,that
instead,of,writing,to,fanny,he,should,go,to,london,and,personally
entreat,her,good,offices,in,hisfavour
and,if,they,really,_do_,interest,themselves,said,marianne,in,her,new
character,of,candour,in,bringing,about,a,reconciliation,i,shall,think,that
even,john,and,fanny,are,not,entirely,withoutmerit
after,a,visit,on,colonel,brandon,s,side,of,only,three,or
four,days,the,two,gentlemen,quitted,bartontogether
they,were,to,go,immediately,to,delaford,that,edward,might,have,some
personal,knowledge,of,his,future,home,and,assist,his,patron,and,friend
in,deciding,on,what,improvements,were,needed,to,it,and,from,thence
after,staying,there,a,couple,of,nights,he,was,to,proceed,on
his,journey,totown
chapter,l,after,a,proper,resistance,on,the,part,of,mrs,ferrars
just,so,violent,and,so,steady,as,to,preserve,her,from,that
reproach,which,she,always,seemed,fearful,of,incurring,the,reproach,of,being
too,amiable,edward,was,admitted,to,her,presence,and,pronounced,to,be
again,herson
her,family,had,of,late,been,exceedinglyfluctuating
for,many,years,of,her,life,she,had,had,two,sons,but
the,crime,and,annihilation,of,edward,a,few,weeks,ago,had,robbed
her,of,one,the,similar,annihilation,of,robert,had,left,her,for
a,fortnight,without,any,and,now,by,the,resuscitation,of,edward,she
had,oneagain
in,spite,of,his,being,allowed,once,more,to,live,however,he
did,not,feel,the,continuance,of,his,existence,secure,till,he,had
revealed,his,present,engagement,for,the,publication,of,that,circumstance,he,feared
might,give,a,sudden,turn,to,his,constitution,and,carry,him,off
as,rapidly,asbefore
with,apprehensive,caution,therefore,it,was,revealed,and,he,was,listened,to
with,unexpectedcalmness
mrs,ferrars,at,first,reasonably,endeavoured,to,dissuade,him,from,marrying,miss
dashwood,by,every,argument,in,her,power,told,him,that,in,miss
morton,he,would,have,a,woman,of,higher,rank,and,larger,fortune
and,enforced,the,assertion,by,observing,that,miss,morton,was,the,daughter
of,a,nobleman,with,thirty,thousand,pounds,while,miss,dashwood,was,only
the,daughter,of,a,private,gentleman,with,no,more,than,_three_,but
when,she,found,that,though,perfectly,admitting,the,truth,of,her,representation
he,was,by,no,means,inclined,to,be,guided,by,it,she
judged,it,wisest,from,the,experience,of,the,past,to,submit,and
therefore,after,such,an,ungracious,delay,as,she,owed,to,her,own
dignity,and,as,served,to,prevent,every,suspicion,of,good,will,she
issued,her,decree,of,consent,to,the,marriage,of,edward,andelinor
what,she,would,engage,to,do,towards,augmenting,their,income,was,next
to,be,considered,and,here,it,plainly,appeared,that,though,edward,was
now,her,only,son,he,was,by,no,means,her,eldest,for
while,robert,was,inevitably,endowed,with,a,thousand,pounds,a,year,not
the,smallest,objection,was,made,against,edward,s,taking,orders,for,the
sake,of,two,hundred,and,fifty,at,the,utmost,nor,was,anything
promised,either,for,the,present,or,in,future,beyond,the,ten,thousand
pounds,which,had,been,given,withfanny
it,was,as,much,however,as,was,desired,and,more,than,was
expected,by,edward,and,elinor,and,mrs,ferrars,herself,by,her,shuffling
excuses,seemed,the,only,person,surprised,at,her,not,givingmore
with,an,income,quite,sufficient,to,their,wants,thus,secured,to,them
they,had,nothing,to,wait,for,after,edward,was,in,possession,of
the,living,but,the,readiness,of,the,house,to,which,colonel,brandon
with,an,eager,desire,for,the,accommodation,of,elinor,was,making,considerable
improvements,and,after,waiting,some,time,for,their,completion,after,experiencing,as
usual,a,thousand,disappointments,and,delays,from,the,unaccountable,dilatoriness,of,the
workmen,elinor,as,usual,broke,through,the,first,positive,resolution,of,not
marrying,till,every,thing,was,ready,and,the,ceremony,took,place,in
barton,church,early,in,theautumn
the,first,month,after,their,marriage,was,spent,with,their,friend,at
the,mansion,house,from,whence,they,could,superintend,the,progress,of,the
parsonage,and,direct,every,thing,as,they,liked,on,the,spot,could
choose,papers,project,shrubberies,and,invent,asweep
mrs,jennings,s,prophecies,though,rather,jumbled,together,were,chiefly,fulfilled,for
she,was,able,to,visit,edward,and,his,wife,in,their,parsonage
by,michaelmas,and,she,found,in,elinor,and,her,husband,as,she
really,believed,one,of,the,happiest,couples,in,theworld
they,had,in,fact,nothing,to,wish,for,but,the,marriage,of
colonel,brandon,and,marianne,and,rather,better,pasturage,for,theircows
they,were,visited,on,their,first,settling,by,almost,all,their,relations
andfriends
mrs,ferrars,came,to,inspect,the,happiness,which,she,was,almost,ashamed
of,having,authorised,and,even,the,dashwoods,were,at,the,expense,of
a,journey,from,sussex,to,do,themhonour
i,will,not,say,that,i,am,disappointed,my,dear,sister,said
john,as,they,were,walking,together,one,morning,before,the,gates,of
delaford,house,_that_,would,be,saying,too,much,for,certainly,you,have
been,one,of,the,most,fortunate,young,women,in,the,world,as
itis
but,i,confess,it,would,give,me,great,pleasure,to,call,colonel
brandonbrother
his,property,here,his,place,his,house,every,thing,is,in,such
respectable,and,excellentcondition
and,his,woods,i,have,not,seen,such,timber,any,where,in
dorsetshire,as,there,is,now,standing,in,delafordhanger
and,though,perhaps,marianne,may,not,seem,exactly,the,person,to,attract
him,yet,i,think,it,would,altogether,be,advisable,for,you,to
have,them,now,frequently,staying,with,you,for,as,colonel,brandon,seems
a,great,deal,at,home,nobody,can,tell,what,may,happen,for
when,people,are,much,thrown,together,and,see,little,of,anybody,else
and,it,will,always,be,in,your,power,to,set,her,off
to,advantage,and,soforth
in,short,you,may,as,well,give,her,a,chance,you,understand
me
but,though,mrs,ferrars,_did_,come,to,see,them,and,always,treated
them,with,the,make,believe,of,decent,affection,they,were,never,insulted
by,her,real,favour,andpreference
_that_,was,due,to,the,folly,of,robert,and,the,cunning,of
his,wife,and,it,was,earned,by,them,before,many,months,had
passedaway
the,selfish,sagacity,of,the,latter,which,had,at,first,drawn,robert
into,the,scrape,was,the,principal,instrument,of,his,deliverance,from,it
for,her,respectful,humility,assiduous,attentions,and,endless,flatteries,as,soon,as
the,smallest,opening,was,given,for,their,exercise,reconciled,mrs,ferrars,to
his,choice,and,re,established,him,completely,in,herfavour
illustration,_everything,in,such,respectable,condition_,the,whole,of,lucy,s,behaviour
in,the,affair,and,the,prosperity,which,crowned,it,therefore,may,be
held,forth,as,a,most,encouraging,instance,of,what,an,earnest,an
unceasing,attention,to,self,interest,however,its,progress,may,be,apparently,obstructed
will,do,in,securing,every,advantage,of,fortune,with,no,other,sacrifice
than,that,of,time,andconscience
when,robert,first,sought,her,acquaintance,and,privately,visited,her,in,bartlett
s,buildings,it,was,only,with,the,view,imputed,to,him,by
hisbrother
he,merely,meant,to,persuade,her,to,give,up,the,engagement,and
as,there,could,be,nothing,to,overcome,but,the,affection,of,both
he,naturally,expected,that,one,or,two,interviews,would,settle,thematter
in,that,point,however,and,that,only,he,erred,for,though,lucy
soon,gave,him,hopes,that,his,eloquence,would,convince,her,in,_time_
another,visit,another,conversation,was,always,wanted,to,produce,thisconviction
some,doubts,always,lingered,in,her,mind,when,they,parted,which,could
only,be,removed,by,another,half,hour,s,discourse,withhimself
his,attendance,was,by,this,means,secured,and,the,rest,followed,in
course
instead,of,talking,of,edward,they,came,gradually,to,talk,only,of
robert,a,subject,on,which,he,had,always,more,to,say,than
on,any,other,and,in,which,she,soon,betrayed,an,interest,even
equal,to,his,own,and,in,short,it,became,speedily,evident,to
both,that,he,had,entirely,supplanted,hisbrother
he,was,proud,of,his,conquest,proud,of,tricking,edward,and,very
proud,of,marrying,privately,without,his,mother,sconsent
what,immediately,followed,isknown
they,passed,some,months,in,great,happiness,at,dawlish,for,she,had
many,relations,and,old,acquaintances,to,cut,and,he,drew,several,plans
for,magnificent,cottages,and,from,thence,returning,to,town,procured,the,forgiveness
of,mrs,ferrars,by,the,simple,expedient,of,asking,it,which,at
lucy,s,instigation,wasadopted
the,forgiveness,at,first,indeed,as,was,reasonable,comprehended,only,robert,and
lucy,who,had,owed,his,mother,no,duty,and,therefore,could,have
transgressed,none,still,remained,some,weeks,longerunpardoned
but,perseverance,in,humility,of,conduct,and,messages,in,self,condemnation,for
robert,s,offence,and,gratitude,for,the,unkindness,she,was,treated,with
procured,her,in,time,the,haughty,notice,which,overcame,her,by,its
graciousness,and,led,soon,afterwards,by,rapid,degrees,to,the,highest,state
of,affection,andinfluence
lucy,became,as,necessary,to,mrs,ferrars,as,either,robert,or,fanny
and,while,edward,was,never,cordially,forgiven,for,having,once,intended,to
marry,her,and,elinor,though,superior,to,her,in,fortune,and,birth
was,spoken,of,as,an,intruder,_she_,was,in,every,thing,considered
and,always,openly,acknowledged,to,be,a,favouritechild
they,settled,in,town,received,very,liberal,assistance,from,mrs,ferrars,were
on,the,best,terms,imaginable,with,the,dashwoods,and,setting,aside,the
jealousies,and,ill,will,continually,subsisting,between,fanny,and,lucy,in,which
their,husbands,of,course,took,a,part,as,well,as,the,frequent
domestic,disagreements,between,robert,and,lucy,themselves,nothing,could,exceed,the,harmony
in,which,they,all,livedtogether
what,edward,had,done,to,forfeit,the,right,of,eldest,son,might
have,puzzled,many,people,to,find,out,and,what,robert,had,done
to,succeed,to,it,might,have,puzzled,them,stillmore
it,was,an,arrangement,however,justified,in,its,effects,if,not,in
its,cause,for,nothing,ever,appeared,in,robert,s,style,of,living
or,of,talking,to,give,a,suspicion,of,his,regretting,the,extent
of,his,income,as,either,leaving,his,brother,too,little,or,bringing
himself,too,much,and,if,edward,might,be,judged,from,the,ready
discharge,of,his,duties,in,every,particular,from,an,increasing,attachment,to
his,wife,and,his,home,and,from,the,regular,cheerfulness,of,his
spirits,he,might,be,supposed,no,less,contented,with,his,lot,no
less,free,from,every,wish,of,anexchange
elinor,s,marriage,divided,her,as,little,from,her,family,as,could
well,be,contrived,without,rendering,the,cottage,at,barton,entirely,useless,for
her,mother,and,sisters,spent,much,more,than,half,their,time,with
her
mrs,dashwood,was,acting,on,motives,of,policy,as,well,as,pleasure
in,the,frequency,of,her,visits,at,delaford,for,her,wish,of
bringing,marianne,and,colonel,brandon,together,was,hardly,less,earnest,though,rather
more,liberal,than,what,john,hadexpressed
it,was,now,her,darlingobject
precious,as,was,the,company,of,her,daughter,to,her,she,desired
nothing,so,much,as,to,give,up,its,constant,enjoyment,to,her
valued,friend,and,to,see,marianne,settled,at,the,mansion,house,was
equally,the,wish,of,edward,andelinor
they,each,felt,his,sorrows,and,their,own,obligations,and,marianne,by
general,consent,was,to,be,the,reward,ofall
with,such,a,confederacy,against,her,with,a,knowledge,so,intimate,of
his,goodness,with,a,conviction,of,his,fond,attachment,to,herself,which
at,last,though,long,after,it,was,observable,to,everybody,else,burst
on,her,what,could,shedo
marianne,dashwood,was,born,to,an,extraordinaryfate
she,was,born,to,discover,the,falsehood,of,her,own,opinions,and
to,counteract,by,her,conduct,her,most,favouritemaxims
she,was,born,to,overcome,an,affection,formed,so,late,in,life
as,at,seventeen,and,with,no,sentiment,superior,to,strong,esteem,and
lively,friendship,voluntarily,to,give,her,hand,to,another,and,_that_,other
a,man,who,had,suffered,no,less,than,herself,under,the,event
of,a,former,attachment,whom,two,years,before,she,had,considered,too
old,to,be,married,and,who,still,sought,the,constitutional,safeguard,of
a,flannelwaistcoat
but,so,itwas
instead,of,falling,a,sacrifice,to,an,irresistible,passion,as,once,she
had,fondly,flattered,herself,with,expecting,instead,of,remaining,even,for,ever
with,her,mother,and,finding,her,only,pleasures,in,retirement,and,study
as,afterwards,in,her,more,calm,and,sober,judgment,she,had,determined
on,she,found,herself,at,nineteen,submitting,to,new,attachments,entering,on
new,duties,placed,in,a,new,home,a,wife,the,mistress,of
a,family,and,the,patroness,of,avillage
colonel,brandon,was,now,as,happy,as,all,those,who,best,loved
him,believed,he,deserved,to,be,in,marianne,he,was,consoled,for
every,past,affliction,her,regard,and,her,society,restored,his,mind,to
animation,and,his,spirits,to,cheerfulness,and,that,marianne,found,her,own
happiness,in,forming,his,was,equally,the,persuasion,and,delight,of,each
observingfriend
marianne,could,never,love,by,halves,and,her,whole,heart,became,in
time,as,much,devoted,to,her,husband,as,it,had,once,been
towilloughby
willoughby,could,not,hear,of,her,marriage,without,a,pang,and,his
punishment,was,soon,afterwards,complete,in,the,voluntary,forgiveness,of,mrs,smith
who,by,stating,his,marriage,with,a,woman,of,character,as,the
source,of,her,clemency,gave,him,reason,for,believing,that,had,he
behaved,with,honour,towards,marianne,he,might,at,once,have,been,happy
andrich
that,his,repentance,of,misconduct,which,thus,brought,its,own,punishment,was
sincere,need,not,be,doubted,nor,that,he,long,thought,of,colonel
brandon,with,envy,and,of,marianne,withregret
but,that,he,was,for,ever,inconsolable,that,he,fled,from,society
or,contracted,an,habitual,gloom,of,temper,or,died,of,a,broken
heart,must,not,be,depended,on,for,he,didneither
he,lived,to,exert,and,frequently,to,enjoyhimself
his,wife,was,not,always,out,of,humour,nor,his,home,always
uncomfortable,and,in,his,breed,of,horses,and,dogs,and,in,sporting
of,every,kind,he,found,no,inconsiderable,degree,of,domesticfelicity
for,marianne,however,in,spite,of,his,incivility,in,surviving,her,loss
he,always,retained,that,decided,regard,which,interested,him,in,every,thing
that,befell,her,and,made,her,his,secret,standard,of,perfection,in
woman,and,many,a,rising,beauty,would,be,slighted,by,him,in
after,days,as,bearing,no,comparison,with,mrsbrandon
mrs,dashwood,was,prudent,enough,to,remain,at,the,cottage,without,attempting
a,removal,to,delaford,and,fortunately,for,sir,john,and,mrs,jennings
when,marianne,was,taken,from,them,margaret,had,reached,an,age,highly
suitable,for,dancing,and,not,very,ineligible,for,being,supposed,to,have
alover
between,barton,and,delaford,there,was,that,constant,communication,which,strong,family
affection,would,naturally,dictate,and,among,the,merits,and,the,happiness,of
elinor,and,marianne,let,it,not,be,ranked,as,the,least,considerable
that,though,sisters,and,living,almost,within,sight,of,each,other,they
could,live,without,disagreement,between,themselves,or,producing,coolness,between,theirhusbands
