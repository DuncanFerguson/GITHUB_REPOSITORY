"""In this assignment, you will be using dynamic programming to select a set of investment options that maximize
your return on investment. you will be given a file of investment options along with the estimated return on
investment for eachone. You also have a given amount of money to invest. The specific file of investment options
you will be given will vary, but you will always have the following three pieces of information you can obtain from
 the file

 InvestmentName, INvestmentCost, EstimatedReturnOninvestment """

    This function returns both the optimal return on investment amount as well as the actual investments selected
