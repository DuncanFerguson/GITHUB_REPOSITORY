# Use a recursive divide-and-concquer algorithm
# The Algorithm states that the distance between the closet pair of points in a list is a minimum of

# Step 1
# Divide: Split the list into two equal pieces

# Step 2
# Conquer: Recursively find the closet pair distance in each sublist (obtains distances 1 and 2 from above

# Step 3 Combine: C
# Compute the remaing distance (3 from above), and combine them by taking the minimum of the tree
